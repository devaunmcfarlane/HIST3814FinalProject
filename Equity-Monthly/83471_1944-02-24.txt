THE WAR • WEEK
Commentary on Current Event*

U
Ships of United States Fleet Ride At Anchor In Japanese Harbor
The war in the Pacific last week entered a new phase. Gathering fnormous forces, including the largest fleet the world lias ever seen, the Americans struck at and won Japanese territory for the first time. Ships of the United States Pacific Fleet rode at anchor in a Japanese harbor, says the New York Times.
The victory was gained at Kwajalein Atoll In the heart of the Marshall Islands. This direct as lault, cracking Japan’s main outer Shield of defenses, brought to full Scale the offensive which has been So long in preparation and which la its preliminary stages has meant long, hard battles on the outer fringes of Japan's conquests.
the largest Japanese airfield in this area. It was captured in four hours. Winning Kwajalein knocked out the keystone of the Japanese structure in the Marshalls.
Battle for Japan
Up to the present the Japanese Navy has been the principal inhibition on the full development of our amphibious strength. But with the taking of Kwajalein, we are reaching the point at which it can be effectively neutralized; either Japan will have to risk it in battle or it will sink, like the German Fleet after Jutland, into strategic impotence. In the Pacific, the battle of the remote outposts Is beginning at last to give way to the battle for Japan. And the Pacific is stil* only one side of the equation; for all this says nothing as to what may be preparing in India and the Bay of Bengal.
Japan Itself Attacked
Last week United States naval forces, for the first time, steamed within shelling range of Japan itself and bombarded Paramushiro, at the extreme northeastern end of the Kurile Island chain.
Paramushiro is not a part of Japanese conquest. It always has been Japanese soil. It is, Japan itself. It has been reached and hit now—not only by long-range bombers, but also by American surface vessels. It is nearly a thousand miles north of the main, thickly inhabited parts of the Japanese Archipelago. But it is Japan. The Japanese Fleet is no longer able to defend its own home islands from our naval forays.
What does it mean, this unexpected and only twenty-minute-long attack on Kurabu Point? Was it just an isolated hit-and-run affair designed to befuddle an enemy at a time when he has reason to he looking for blows from the South and East; or was It the prelude to an all-out drive, even possibly landings on this farthest North of the Japanese bases?
The War Lords of Tokyo will ponder this one carefully, for it might he either. It is no secret that the United States has been building up Northern bases, including, no doubt, substantial improvements to the Aleutians.

Last month's mild weather sent egg production soaring in all parts of Canada according to a report of the Special Products Board which buys for British contract purposes. Up to January 22 the total number of cars offered to the Board was 284 compared with 1%1 for the same period last year. All provinces shared in the increase.
Strike For High Stake Invading the Marshalls, the Navy was striking for the highest stake vet in Pacific strategy. Japan molding the islands under mandate fince World War I, had made them Into air and sea bases and knit them into her great scheme for war. About 8,150 miles from Tokyo, they flank the sea road to Hawaii and may have been the Rendezvous for the fleet which attacked Pearl Harbour. They also flank the route to the Solomons. In American hands they will flank the Japanese positions in the Carolines, due west, where the great bases of Truk and Ponapc are major bastions.

"Softening Up”
That the attack on the Marshalls was coming could hardly have been in doubt to the Japanese. Long-range Army and Navy planes had been bombarding the islands steadily since mid-November, a campaign stepped up through January. It was “softening up" on a scale greater than the Pacific had ever seen before. Shipping, shore defenses, docks, runaways, seaplane ramps, hangars, fuel and ammunition dumps and gun positions were blasted day after day.
For two days before H-hour came, carrier planés, long-range bombers and heavy units of the fleet subjected the islands to a staggering I bombardment.
The Fleet Moves In
The invasion came in the form of a great two-pronged attack from north and south. Carriers, the largest and newest battleships, transports, cargo ships, tankers, landing craft for tanks and infantry—a total estimated as at least 2,000,000 tons—had been drawn from the mainland of the United States and from every large Pacific base.
When the landing forces swept ashore they encountered stiff resistance at some points, but it was limited to small-arms fire. Artillery had apparently heed blasted out of existence. Not one enemy plane was sighted during the approach to the islands or during the invasion.

Reporting the theft of a large quantity of tobacco at Simcoe, The St. Thomas Times-Journal says the thieves must have “puffed” quite a bit in caryidg it away.

Asked in the House of Commons if he has received any request from Britain to increase Canadian exports of butter, Hon. J. G. Gardiner stated, “Last year we shipped from this country to Great Britain since the beginning of the war, (7,000,000 pounds). The shipment was not made as a result of any intention on our part, or any desire expressed previously by the British Government. Our present position is that Britain desires all the cheese she can get from Canada, and has expressed no desire that we should take any milk from cheese production in order to produce a supply of butter for her. Our present intention is to follow her wishes in that regard, and to produce as much cheese as possible.”

the Governments United Kingdom.
Mr Singleton, that dairy products exported from Canada to Britain have been almost entirely shipments through ] the Dairy products Board in fulfilment of contracts between the Governments
of the two countries.
Exports to destinations other than the United Kingdom are under strict control. An export permit is required for each shipment of value m excess of $5 and unless the proposed export is in order, authorization to export is denied.
These exports are confined almost exclusively to other parts of the Empire, such as the British West Indies, Newfoundland. British Guiana, India, Ley-Ion and other parts, and the exports in accord with the wishes of the British Ministry of Food. They are under «.nota arrangements, quotas being established either on a quarterly or yearly basis in what is considered to be minimum requirements Also there are ports of relatively small quantities to liossessions of countries maintaining governments in exile which are cooperating with the Allies—for example, the French possessions of St. Pierre and Miquelon, to Dutch Guiana, and to the
Belgian Congo.

Preparation for seeding includes buying the seed, cleaning, treating it for disease, and putting the planting machinery in shade to do ihe necessary
work without a hitch,
Perhaps the immediate necessity for care and early attention to these suggestions is more urgent this year than ever before. Machinery is aging ami becoming more liable to breakdowns ; spare parts are not always easily obtained, and following last years unfavour able season, good seed is scarce.
Good seed has certain essential characteristics. The most important <>f these are good germinating power and growing ability, often summed up in the term viability, freedom from weeds and other crops, and purity and suitability of variety
Good germination and freedom from impurities are assured when seed is purchased by grade, and purity of variety when registered seed is used.

should be made. This can be done at home or a sample can be sent to the nearest seed laboratory for an official analysis

Possibly the largest daytime audience of any Canadian radio program belongs to “They Tell Me*' conducted by Claire Wallace. Claire in private life is just as charming and vivacious a personality as she is on the radio; her
charm being only matched by her modesty. She was the first Canadian woman to fly the Atlantic as a passenger. She has travelled extensively in Canada s north country, and is well liked by her colleagues in the broadcasting industry.
assigned to cover the balloon's arrival.
"They Tell Me" Is sponsored by the National War Finance Committee and is carried by every radio station in Canada. It is heard over CKCL Mondays through Fridays from 4.15-4.30 p.m.
Claire has an intense personal interest in the war inasmuch as her husband is serving with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps on one of Canada's coasts, and her son is serving In the Navy.

The owner of the ass, as a faithful and dutiful servant of the Lord, would straightway comply with Christ's request. The true servant of Christ is ever ready and willing to do the Lord's will.
"And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him." It needed faith and courage on the part of the disciples to do their Lord's bidding, but they implicitly believed Hi* word and meted upon it.
Christ's Word Effective
“And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: And they let them go." The owners would be surprised to set the apostles loosing the colt but they let them go.' By that action they admitted the right of the Lord to have first claim upon their property. The disciples did not make Of any explanation of their own In loosing the colt. It was Christ's word they spoke, not their own, and they found it effective at once. Too often, we fail in Christian service because we give too much time to what others say, and too little to what Oirist says. It is His word that men need; it h His word which alone is effective with men.
The King of the Jews
"And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him." The disciples cast their garments upon the colt, both as a saddle, and to render Him royal homage. Christ mounted the colt that He might enter the Holy City as the King of the Jews.
"And many spread their garments upon the way; #nnd others branches, which they had cut from the fields." Many catching the enthusiasm of the moment, spread their garments, in place of tapestry or webs of cloth, along the way where Jesus would pass. Others took branches from palm trees and strewed them in the way. From this act the day has received the popular name of Palm Sunday.

ter to be safe than sorry, especially where a car is concerned it certainly didn't add to my comfort. I knew 1 should have tried my luck at getting a couple of new tires, but what with one thing and another I had put it off. Now I was really driven to it. The application was sent away. And I waited, and waited, and waited I Each passing day increased my uneasiness, 1 heard rumors of applications being turned down; of government regulations being tightened up—and I can tell you that shabby old '30 of ours began to look like a million dollars.

( laire't a pretty smart girl, one example being that some years ago before the war, she and I were both assigned by our respective radio stations to cover the arrival of a lighter than airship in Toronto. They landed at a flying field outside Toronto and made arrangements to take the visiting press and radio men up for a trial flight. Your columnist, who is in excess of 200 pounds, was among the six who won seats on the balloon for the first flight. Apparently too much weight was allowed aboard and coming in over the fence the balloon tore off its tail assembly. Claire, who had drawn the second flight, was waiting on the ground and when your commentator got off the balloon he gave Claire a bit of ribbing that due to the damage to the tail of the balloon, there would be no further flying that morning.
That afternoon we were assigned to the Island airport to describe the arrival of the balloon at that point. It was supposed to be arriving with only the crew, but when it landed at the Island airport a lone lady stepped from the balloon, you guessed it. ClaTe had remained with the ship until it was fixed and had wangled herself a private ride the rest of the way into Toronto and, as a matter of fact, she wound up with the best story of all of us who had been

This menu-cook-book is far more than a cook-book, for it includes seasonal menus for every day in the year, shopping lists to guide your marketing week by week, and hundreds of tempting new recipes —with explicit directions.
Miss Bradley’s menus show imagination as well as dietetic balance. She suggests how even the simplest foods can be made appetite-teasing and delicious, and how they should be chosen for their energy-giving qualities and their suitability to the season. In fact, in this book she gives you the same expert help in cooking and menu-planning that has made her school so*famous.

Blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest." The people hail Him joyfully as their promised king. Our Saviour passes on, meek and grave. It is a scene of triumph, but He knows He is even now drawing nigh to Calvary.

Interest in the sunflower as a grain crop came about largely because of the shortage of edible vegetable oils in Canada soon after the outbreak of the present war, states Dr. T. M. Stevenson, Dominion Agrostologist. Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa.
The ensilage varieties which were tall growing and late maturing, were not suited as a grain crop in most areas. However, other types were availalbe. Canadian plant breeders had, some years prior to the outbreak of war. recognized the possibility of using the sunflower as a grain crop, chiefly is a source of vegetable oil. They set about to develop varieties suitable for grain production on a large scale. They decided first of all that such varieties must be semi-dwarf in habit of growth and early maturing so that they could be harvested satisfactorily by ordinary farm machinery. Furthermore, the new varieties had to meet certain standards of perfection respecting oid content and oil quality.
Two Outstanding Varieties The two outstanding varieties which resulted from that work are “Sunrise” and “Mennonite”. Approximately 30,000 acres of these varieties were grown for grain in the prairie provinces in 1943. It is estimated that this yield over 181/2
of seed. This crop is capable of providing million pounds of high quality edible oil and than 2,250 tons of excellent, high protein oil meal * suitable for stock feed. In addition there will be an abundance of seed available to enable us to meet the 50,000 acre objective set for 1944.
The development and production of sunflo «ers for grain constitutes another worthwhile tribution from agriculture to the war effort.

Suddenly blind rage filled Ferris’ heart. And, according to the turc of the man, it did not show Itself upon his face, which became a mask. Stupidly, blindly trying to find reality in this new confusion, Ferris rode back toward his ranch house with a sudden resolution formed.
Weak, irresolute, he was following the traditional line of least resistance in seeking a confidant. And Curran, the foreman, was the man he sought.

During the past several months, a number of misleading statements have been circulated regarding the strength of alcoholic beverages sold under the new Federal regulations. The following facts will no doubt help to clear up a greatly exaggerated situation.

duced from 42.8 percent alcohol to 40 percent alcohol.
From these facts it is easily realized that alcoholic beverages in general have not been greatly altered. And it is interesting to note in passing that in Great Britain, most of the alcoholic beverages offered for sale stronger than 30 degrees underproof. (30 U.P.) Scottish distillers and all others who. engage themselves in this business would be surprised indeed, if told that this particular alcoholic strength indicated an adulteration of their products. A number of these overseas products are also offered for sale at a strength of 40 degrees underproof (40 U.P.) which corresponds to 60 degrees proof or its equivalent, 34.3 percent alcohol by volume.
Before the new regulations concerning strength were imposed, the alcoholic strength of beverages sold in this province such as Scotch whisky, rye whisky, gin, cognac and brandy, approximately 42.S percent alcohol by volume, corresponding to 75 degrees proof (British Proof Spirit) or its equivalent — 25 degrees underproof (25 U.P.)

That was the situation before the new regulations of November, 1942 were applied. This new wartime law specified that all alcoholic
to be bottled and
beverages which were placed on the market were not to be stronger
than 30 degrees underproof (30 U.P.)—that is, 70 degrees proof or its equivalent, 40 per-alcohol by volume. Thus it can be that most of our alcoholic berer-had their alcoholic strength re-

The Quebec Liquor Commission publishes this information in the hope that the public will reply to those who see fit pretend that all alcoholic beverages sold in Quebec today are adulterated heavily. It also takes this occasion to point out to the public that it is in no way responsible for the present situation which was brought about by regulations imposed by Federal authorities. The situation in Quebec is exactly the same as that existing in every other province of the Dominion where alcoholic beverages are sold.

Mitchell Foresaw Paratroopers
The American parachute troops who spearheaded the invasion of Sicily fulfilled a prophecy made 22 years ago by Gen. William (“Billy”) Mitchell in the National Geographic magazine.
In an article published in March, 1921, entitled “America in the Air,” he listed soldiers attacking by parachute among the spectacular developments to be expected from the Air age.
gince the small airplane of that time was unable to carry enough men to fill the needs of his imagination, he « envisioned the future paratrooper as traveling almost soundlessly to his objective in a giant dirigible. “A large airship can carry 200 fully equipped infantrymen and drop them off in parachutes if necessary ”
True to General Mitchell’s dream, today’s paratroops are a part of the infantry, although many people associate them with the air forces.
