EVER SEE A BLACK MARKET?
he’s in love!” he thought.
But it troubled him. He tramped the streets, thinking of it, wretched at heart. It was past midnight when he went in search of Teddy Banks. He wanted his own clothes. Besides, it was part of the bargain to report to the young scapegrace. He found Banks alone and sulky— his rooms, a bachelor's suite, thick with cigarette smoke.
"I won,” said Mark, beginning to take off his coat.
Banks stared at him, biting his cigarette.
"I know! Archie's been here, ripping mad. What the deuce did you do there, anyway?”
"Got asked to dinner. Did he pay his wager? '

Teddy nodded. "He did, and swore he'd like to murder me! Come, what happened? Tell me I” "Nothing happened. I was well received and asked to dinner."
"By the great lady herself? Teddy slapped his knee, laughing uproariously. "What did I say? Any fellow with a clean shirt! 1 got my money out of Archie." •
"Archie says you threw back five hundred dollars. Why?"
"You'd better ask me why I took it in the first place," Mark retorted bitterly. *‘I think 1 was mad."
Some remnant of conscience jtirred in young Banks.
"It was only for tonight!" he called after him thickly. "Only for
tonight; that’s flat, remember—you can’t go back there, you know!"
Mark thought the boy had been drinking again. He did not answer. He shut the door on him and went to walk the streets all night.

When I was i little girl and heard a motorcar coining down the street I would run to see it go by. I do the same thing now because cars on our snow-banked roads are as great a novelty as they were in those early days. In the mornings I watch to see if the cars are getting through—we know then whether it will be possible for our milk to be collected. We live on a provincial highway and every effort is made to keep it open hut there is still only a narrow cut just wide enough for a car or truck to get through, as the snowploughs have not yet had a chance to use a wing, so quickly does the snow fill in each day. Our hasn't been out since Christmas Eve but Partner has made several trips with the sleighs and John has walked to town two or three times. But I—well, I'm a fair-weather traveller—I haven't left the house this year.

But we mortals are not the only ones with problems—our feathered friends have them too. One day 1 law something flutter to . the ground from the big poplar tree, just as a leaf might fall. Presently it moved and 1 saw it was an owl —a screech owl. It appeared to be stunned but after awhile it found itself a sheltered nook where a piece of bark had fallen away. At dinner time it was still there so John went out, caught it, and took it over to the driving shed where it could shelter from the storm. John said it was stiff with cold. Another time 1 heard such a commotion in the back porch. It proved to be a little nuthatch come in for cover I suppose, and then not at all happy when it found itself in close quarters. This little grey bird is sometimes called the “up-sidedown" bird, as well it might. I watched its antics for awhile and saw that it could hang by its feet from the ceiling just as easily as it could perch right side up from a level shelf. But 1 couldn't see the little thing unhappy for too long •o I opened the door and away it went.

There are plenty of stories as a result of the storm—starting as it did on New Year's day. Many people were caught going to, or from, family "get-togethers" and had to stay wherever the car decided to stop. Many farm homes had unexpected guests overnight, or for two or three days, depending on where the farms were situated, as the ploughs were only able lo open the main roads. Some of the back concessions are still impassable even for teams. Milk shippers had their own troubles— farmers having to take their milk lo the nearest trucking centre, driving anywhere from one to five miles in open sleighs and often in a blinding storm. (City folk, please mote! The milk doesn't arrive on your doorstep without some effort on the part of the farmers.) Doctors, too have been hard-hit, having sometimes to make trips by train to outlying districts. In other cases neighbours have spent many weary hours, digging and shovelling, so that the doctor might make

Fosdick, coming in to find him there, waiting, was no more cordial than on the previous day. But he took the matter up; it was apparent that his idea was to get done with it and with Mark.

Mark lifted his head. "No, I wasn’t there by any chance. I don't know her, Mrs. Lynn."
His hostess looked perplexed. "But she should be your cousin; there are so few Byrams. You must come in on the Tom Byrain side?"
Mark caught the gleeful malice in LandotVs eyes.
"No," ht replied flatly, "not on any side. You're mistaken, Mrs. Lynn. I'm not related to the Utica Byrams."
She was a little taken aback. But a woman of the world passes such things over lightly; she turned the conversation swiftly, though her eyes flashed one keen question at Landon. He reddened and moved uneasily in his chair. It was Pam who spoke softly to Mark.
"I’m so glad! Those Utica Byrams are so stodgy. I didn’t see how you could belong!"
"I might be a hop out of kin, you know," he answered quickly, and then, in an undertone: “Suppose 1 m not a Byram at all; what then?"
"Oh, but it's your name!" she laughed, as if at a huge joke.
"But if it wasn’t my name?"
She lifted lire shining eyes, mis-% chief in them. "What was it Juliet said? ‘A rose by any other name?' *'

Aspirin Eases Headache Almost Immediately
Yesterday afternoon there was a sudden lull in the wind. The sun came out and it was a nice winter's day for about an hour. And in that time birds came to the field fence from every direction flying and running weeds could be seen above the !

We are often reminded to put out food for the birds in wintertime but I hardly think that is I necessary on farms because none of the farm buildings is so tight J but what little birds can find a way I in, and can feed on chaff or even I grain. But no doubt they are like I humans—they enjoy a change of diet—and when they can get out-then out they come, to feed on the most delectable weeds they can find.

Pam said nothing. She had told him all these things already, and another—she was in the habit of riding her pet horse in the park, mornings. This was something Archie Landon did not know; she did not want Landon and Banks there! It was after he left the house that Mark had his bad quarter of an huor. He had gone there as an impostor, on the wager of two worthless boys, under an assumed name. It would be black enough for a mere joke, but lie was an ex-convict. Given that, and they found him out, he would deserve something worse than mere expulsion.

Fosdick shrugged. "Are you trying to imagine Burleson will clear you now ?"
Mark rose, lie had money in his pocket; he looked grimly down at the sneering little man. x
“A man has a right to fight fur his life, .Mr. Fosdick. I'm young still. I've got red blood in me— I'm going to light for my life."
Fosdick looked him over thoughtfully. For the first time lie seemed to realize the man who had come back. There was power in the ligure and the tace; Mark stood upright, unashamed. In spite of himself the little lawyer was impressed. But he fingered the papers on his desk impatiently; he was not to admit he had been touched

\ ir.d Cooked Cull Beans


Good Feed for Hogs
Raw beans arc unpalatable for hugs i: *.d should be cooked before feeding. Cvoking not only increases the pala-tability but also increases the digestibility.
Good results have been obtained by feeding two parts of grain to one part of cooked cull beans. If the hogs ai e on dry lot feeding, add some animal protein, such as meat meal ot skim milk, as well as feeding from 5 to 10 per cent ground alfalfa, 1 per ^ent oyster shell and *4 per cent salt. Beans should be cooked separately and never cooked with the grain or any grain mixture.

Other types of livestock, such as cattle or sheep, utilize beans quite well-without cooking. In fact, cooking does not add anything to their feeding value, but simply makes them more palatable for hogs.
For best results in feeding beans, to cattle or sheep, add from 15 to 20 per cent ground cull beans to a grain ration. Experiments have shown that each ton of cull beans is equivalent in feed value to over a ton of alfalfa and nearly a ton of barley. Feeding results will not be satisfactory when beans are fed to either cattle or sheep in larger quanti-

The grim headlines of the past few months are a lesson to all of us. Victory is not yet ours... may not be ours for some time to come.
That is the reason why this distillery will continue, in the months ahead, to devote its facilities to the manufacture of alcohol for war purposes. This is our first concern—to see to it that our organization produces war alcohol... for this precious substance is contained in the explosives for torpédos and bombs... it guides the flier on his perilous way, as a component of bis compass ... it is in the merciful drugs and medicines of the battlefield... and in the lacquers and paints which sheathe war material.
Alcohol for war is needed in great quantities. Until Victory is won, our plant is at the disposal of the Government for the manufacture of alcohol for war!

,ATC Hauls Army Freight
On Many World Lines
Typical of wartime developments in the air-cargo field is the Air Transport command of the U. S. army air forces. Until June, 1941, this organization did not exist. It was created for the simple chore of delivering completed lend-lease airplanes from factory to points of departure in the United States. The ATC entered 1943, however, with a network of sir routes aggregating 90,000 miles, radiating from the United States to every part of the United Nations world.
ATC planes carry all sorts of flying freight. Mail to sod from soldiers is figured in tons. In a 'sample month of 1943 before the Christmas rush began, in the Africa-Middle East sector alone, ATC planes carried 29 million pieces of mail.
Ammunition and airplane engines appear on lists of ATC cargo, battle-front-bound. Homeward trips bring such raw materials as diamonds, rubber seeds, and silk.

To get good results from your hatching eggs It is essential to feed a good Hatching Ration.

Wire Nails
Wire nails were not manufactured in the United Stales before 1351, at which time a New York inventor brought forward a device for the
purpose
This inventor was William Hassall
of Brooklyn
were still performing as late as the 1890s in the establishment of John Hassall, his son.
The Hassall invention made the nails from iron or brass wire until the introduction of Bessemer steel wire The nails were small at first and largely used for upholstery Only in the 1880s did the wire nail definitely come into general service.

Cannery Wastes
Utilization of various waste products from canneries—good livestock feeds in their own right—is especially desirable this year because of the vast livestock production programs and the demands they are making on the nation's feed resources, says the department of agriculture. Cannery wastes include such products as dried pea vines, pea-vine silage, sweet-corn husks, and tomato seed meal. In localities where these are available, their conservation and proper use in livestock rations is urged as a means of relieving the demand for other feeds.
If your livestock could talk—they’d be asking you for fresh feed! They don’t relish stale feed any more than you do. So why give it to them? Make absolutely sure the feed you give them is fresh by getting it from your nearby SHUR-GAIN FEED

Studio Couches
Strawberry Mulch Strawberries need a mulch of straw or hay for the winter, both to protect the roots from the alternate freezing and thawing which breaks them and heaves up the then rootless plants, and also to protect the fruit buds from extreme cold. The mulch usually should go on the strawberry bed in late November, before the ground freezes thoroughly. Several inches of straw or hay make the best mulch. Leaves mat down easily and kill some ol the crowns of the plants, but may be used if nothing else is handy.

CANADA 8 OUTPUT
Despite our loss by fire on Sunday night, Jan 7th, we wish to announce that we will continue in buisness.
At this time we express thanks for the kindly assistance of many friends, and for the patronage accorded us in past years.
Montreal, Jan. 17.—Lord Barnby, noted British industrialist, who , reached Montreal today from London, said that if the British Government had realized Canada's poten- j tialities as an industrial nation he ! felt that the Dominion’s industrial capacity would have been out to I greater use.
Associated with the textile industry in Great Briain, Canada and the United States for many years and a former member of the British Parliament, he said he had great confidence in the future developement of Canada.
British people were proud of the "magnificent efforts’’ of the Canadian armed forces.
Discussing Government controls, Lord Barnby said it was clear there must be a continuance of overriding regulations to some extent for a considerable period after the war. It was unlikely that clothes rationing could be lifted suddenly in Britain and probably it would continue‘‘for some time".

The largest Navy in the world, fighting the most extended war in history now has 1,167 men-ol-war to carry the battle to the enemy. And it is still growing.
This wa reported by the United States Navy in a review of ship production which showed that in the last year 39,971 new vessels — 420 of them fighting ships — joined the fleet, boosting the overall total to 61,045 Navy ships of all types.

At leset some of the private enterprises of the United States realize that the survival of private enterprise depends upon vigorous competition and the lowest cible celling price of goods, says the Winnipeg Free Press.
The Ford Company announces that, despite advanced costs during the war years, it will produce a mew and thoroughly modern car at pre-war prices when peace comes. This announcement denies the general expectation that cars muat sell at higher prices after the war because manufacturing costs are higher; for against higher costa stands increased efficiency and its full use.
Mr. C. E. Wilson, president of General Electric announces that when his firm goes back to civilian production its good will sell at pre-war prices, despite all the increased costs of operation. Other manufacturers in the
have been suggesting that their goods must advance from 10 to 35 percent in price. Mr. Wilson sees no such necessity, and he proposes to maintain his present wage level. He can do both he evidently believes, by handing on to the consumer and the wage earner the benefits of mass production and improved techniques.
