A billion bushel crop is in sight In the United States, and the outlook in Canada is promising though It is too early to interpret Canadian conditions in terms of bushels. Substantial increase in acreage and maintenance of present crop prospects in the prairie provinces, however, could only mean better than average production. Both countries will have sizeable carry-over stocks of old wheat on July 3t when the current crop year closes.

Since the steam could not be seen, ships' captains had no way of knowing which of perhaps a half dozen motor ships anchored in the same general vicinity might be signalling.
John Hays Hammand, the most prolific of American inventors, seeks to provide the motor ship with a visual, as well as an auditory signal, vised a gadget that will spray white powder into the air each time the air whistle is sounded. Thus it will be possible to “see” the sound as well as hear it. designers of the streamlined Diesel trains will take advantage of Mr. Hammond's invention.

The southern hemisphere countries of Australia and Argentina are now seeding their new wheat crops, with both expecting to show increase in acreage over last year. British growers are reported to have seeded three million acres, or nearly double the prewar average. Prospects in neutral countries principally Eire. Spain, Portugal and Turkey are favorable, though Spain and Portugal are likely to remain on an import basis 1944-45. The position of occupied countries also appears with the possible exception of Romania. The harvest in North Africa is believed to have yielded a fair surplus which can probably be diverted to Italy. The southern Italian crop will also be available to the United Nations instead of the Nazis.

There is a further threat to the food supplies of the Nazis this year with the Allies driving up through northern Italy where a large crop is usually produced, and now attacking in France, where harvest has commenced in the southern areas. In India where a wheat crop of about 387 million bushels has recently been gathered, there still appears to be a shortage. Conditions are not as critical as last year but It is expected that imports will continue to he necessary.

MEAL PLANNING AND MEAL BUYING will be a cheer instead of a chore when
groceries on wheels rush fresh foods to the housewife's door I Spotless, gloss-roofed giant trailers, stopping in every block, will open up one side, creating platform and steps .. •
and madam's grocery and meat market is ready for business.
c.
HOUSEKEEPING will become a high and thrilling adventure when the time comes for turning airplanes back into refrigerators and kitchen sinks. You’ll see food-mixers that almost “think”, air conditioners that keep a house dust-free, and rugs cleaned in a jiffy by electronic “sweepers’. These and a score of other household “miracles” are being planned for you by men who think of tomorrow 1
• But only if we perform our appointed tasks
today will there be a tomorrow to 'ook forward to. There is a war to win first! . . .
• At no time in history have the people of a nation had so great a responsibility for the victory of their armies. It is everyone’s war . . . everyone’s job to keep up production, to cooperate in salvage and conservation programs, and above all, to help finance the war with their dollars by buying and keeping Victory Bonds and War Savings Certificates.

LESSON
unless she wanted to be hounded by curiosity seekers — that Christine felt sorry for him. So much so that when he asked her almost wistfully to have dinner with him, she answered, “I have an engagement to meet a friend at 9; but I'd like ever so much to have dinner with you, Mr. Wilmet, if you don't mind my running away early.”
At first Mr. Wilmet looked crestfallen; then he brightened.
“If it's Mr. Yardley you're to meet," he said hopefully, “I just heard them tell him at detective headquarters that they might keep him till late tonight."
"Oh," Christine said blankly, “so you've been to headquarters, too?”
“Inspector Parsons sent for me," Mr. Wilmet admitted. “About not being able to prove where I was last night. As if I wouldn’t have sense enough to get an alibi ready before I killed
Thorenson, you don't suppose he really thinks I had anything to do with this?"
"Do you — I don't suppose you know what they wanted with Mr. Yardley?”
"It was about his keys,” Mr. Wilmet told her chattily.

For a moment Inspector Parsons simply sat and looked at her. Finally he said softly, almost as if to himself, "I wonder if any policeman ever got the whole truth from any woman at any one time. . You said you read that early morning extra, Miss Thoren-•on. You must have seen the story about the abandoned launch the Coast Guard searched. Suppose I should tell you that, shortly after dark yesterday evening, this Jaspar rowed out to that launch and spent some time aboard?"
“Are you telling me that?"
“In so many words.”
“Then." Christine surprised herself by telling him, “if that launch really had anything to do with the murder, I should say that Jaspar would have been too smart to stick his neck out that way if he really murdered my cousin."

THE LESSON IN ITS SETTING
The oppression of Israel by Jabin, king of Canoaan, lasted, according to the chronology of Gars tang, from 1221 to 1201, the latter year (1201) being the time of the gçeat battle of the Kishon, which we will be studying today.
Place.—The principal locality in our lesson, is the River Kishon, in the plain of Megiddo,
Palestine.

someone... Miss
We have had such a grand week for getting the work done — and we are so thankful. Yes, the weather was perfect for haying, even to that Wednesday when it was 9ft in the shade, which, f mirst confess, was a little hard to take. However, wc survived, Partner and I; we also got quite a bit of hay in that day — maybe because wê didn't realise how hot it had been until we listened to the newscast at supper-time. Then we were so terribly afraid the intense heat would bring a storm. But it didn’t — and we were glad! You see we were specially anxious for the fine weather to continue because we were expecting a friend from the city to help with the hay on Friday and Saturday. Inexperienced help — but very willing. Had he been able to stay longer there would have been a lot more hay brought in. However we are hoping for “Farm Commando" help next Monday — whether it will be experienced or inexperienced is anyone's guess — but we are thankful for help of
any kind these days.
* * *
We had many a laugh at our friend's expense last Friday and Saturday in which he joined wholeheartedly. He had so little idea of what “haying" really meant. He had never seen a hay fork in action and for that reason Partner had to explain why a load should be built a certain way and not just any way at all. It was amusing too, to watch him get his “wagon-legs". But he soon caught on and finally built a pretty fair load. But the
first ones to come in were queer looking specimens!
I can tell you we think pretty well of any man who is willing to spend a well-earned holiday helping out on a farm. After all It takes courage to tackle a job you know nothing about — and there is no denying the fact that haying and harvest is hot, hard and heavy work. Maybe there will be a better understanding between town and country folk after the war than before it.
On a desperate impulse Christine found a telephone booth, dialed the number, and asked for Lucille... It would be better not to give her own name, she decided; so when a girl's voice answered, she began, feeling her way guardedly, “I wonder if it was you I talked to over the Beachmont change night before last? to call you, if—"
“Oh, Miss Thorenson, I've been so afraid you wouldn't!" the other girl broke in. “And I couldn’t think how to get word to you after you left the Crestview."
“Well, I'm calling

The Unhappy Israelites
“And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah . . . the captain of who^e host was Sisera, who dwelt in Jlarosheth of the Gentiles.”
It was the Lord who sold them into the hand of their enemy, for He had a lesson to teach His people, and only in misery and suffering could they learn that lesson. It was their own sins which weakened them and made them an easy prey to the Canaanites.
“And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twncty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.” In their trouble and misery, brought on by their unfaitfulness to God. the people of Israel cried unto Him for help. As so many do, they prayed to God only when they trouble.

Do you know what we had for dinner last Saturday — I'll bet you'll wish you were here. Fried Chicken... how would that suit you? It was the first one this year. But perhaps it is just as well you were not here because by the time we got through there was nothing left but the bones.
Maybe I am wrong but I never can see the sense of economising too much on what is raised on the farm. After all why shouldn’t we eat as many eggs and chicken, and use as much milk as is good for us? In other words why not use more of what we raise and buy less of what we don’t raise. Another case of — What is there that the vinter's buy, one half so precious
as the goods they sell?”

The trains sound like rain; the sunset looks like fine weather — which shall we believe? Maybe neither — we will just go on working and take what weather the good Lord sends us . . . and hope that it will be fine.

Christine was; but she steadied herself to ask, “What did Yardley say?" -
"He said ’ — Mr. Wilmet's inflection deplored the flimsiness of Bill's story — “that he did sit in a parked car near the Boardwalk for a few minutes to wait for someone; but that he didn’t know why he had that key, unless it was that when he got out, he forgot the car wasn't his, and seeing a key in the door, just took it out and put it with his others.”
Christine stood very still for a moment; but her mind raced, trying to sort and piece together scraps of memory.
Xfr. Wilmet was saying insistently, “Shall we say 7, then, at Decker’s?”

“I was 10 years old then,” Christine said. “Are you suggesting that 1 had something to do with that, too?”
He ignored that.
“This Jaspar was employed by Mrs. Talbert at that time, also, wasn’t he?”
“Ever since I can remember.”
“Can you think,” he demanded, -of anyone who might have sent that will to the newspaper?”
“Not unless that was Jaspar, too.

Deborah, The Leader
"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time . . . and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.” Deborah was an inspired leader and chief, and roused the nation to action and with Barak led the army into battle. She encouraged the people to trust in the Lord and look to Him for deliverance.

"How should I know you?”
"I'll be window shopping; and I’ll wear a dark blue dress with a cherry hat and belt. I'll know you from your pictures in the paper. Don’t speak to me; just follow — you know, kind of care-
when I move on.”
"Why, I
¦¦HI yes, all right,” Christine answered, and moved away, her legs dragging numbly as if in some hideous dream.
If Bill's explanation had sounded pitifully thin even to Mr. Wilmet, how would it sound to Inspector Parsons' case-hardened ear?
Iessly
It sounded so incredibly bizarre that Christine opened her mouth to refuse. Then, on one of her unpredictable impulses, she decided, “All right. At 9 then.”
"Wait!” the girl called sharply. “You won’t — say anything to the police?”
"Of course not,” Christine recklessly burned her bridges.
Deborah’s Plan
"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali . . . and I will deliver him Into thy hand.” When the army of Siscr.t had been drawn to the liver now dry, God would cause the rain suddenly to descend and the river would overflow its banks and the land become flooded. The heavy chariots would be imbedded in the mud unable to move, and then from Mount Tabor, Barak would sweep down upon them and slaughter the foes of Israel.
Deborah and Barak "And Barak said unto her, . . . and Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.” Deborah accompanied Barak right up to the hour of battle, and seemed to have been his strength and confidence.
"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots . . . and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.” Sisera trusted in his chariots but God made them less, for they floundered in the mud, and the proud pagan captain had to trust tô his feet and to his swift steeds for flight. God’s armies are invisible but they become very real to His people in time of distress.
Israel Is Delivered
"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.” Israel was completely delivered again. By whom? Deborah? Barak, the Army? No, by God who used them. It wns the Lord’s work and to Him Deborah raised hymn of thanksgiving (Judg 5: 1-5).

The giant sequoias of the High Sierra do not ordinaryly produce many seeds until they are several hundred years old.

It is in order, that all physically qualified Canadians of the home front resolve to become regular blood donors, returning again and again where they are needed, just as our fighters rally again and again to the challenge of battle. The best blood of Canad.t is in the fight, and the remaining best blood must continue to flow from Canada in a life-saving stream.

When she came out from the booth, she bought a newspaper. There was, she decided after one glance at the front page, such a thing as being entirely too photogenic. As th{ girl Lucille had intimated, there could be no mistaking the original of her published pictures. Already people were staring at her. She spent four of her cherished dollars for a wide-brimmed hat and a pair of sun-glasses.
It was already 10:30 when she remembered that she was to meet Mr. Wilmet at that hour.
Christine’s confidence in her sketchily assembled disguise was strengthened when Mr. Wilmet, peering anxiously (yom the drug store, failed to recognize her until she spoke to him.
"Well, well!" he exclaimed, blinking at her. "You’ve done something to yourself. And a smart idea, too. One of those impertinent reporters followed me two blocks trying to get an interview."
• Nevertheless, it occurred to Christine that the little man’s sudden notoriety had pleasantly titillated his ego.
