| Notes of County of Pontiac Agricultural Society, No. 1
THE EQUITY
ANNOUNCEMENT
Thursday. February 22, 1945
I It is now some time since the ' annual meeting of the members of the County of Pontiac Agricultural ( Society, No. 1, was held These notes 1 ( have been delayed with a desire to report at the same time, two things that affect Shaw ville Fair:—
(1)	Shawville Fair. September 20, 21. 22 does not this year, clash with Renfrew Fair. Sept. 11. 12, 13, and 14.
(2)	Daniel’s Greater Shows, the Midway, has been arranged for Shawville Fair.
The annual meeting was well attended with the President. Hurst Hudgins, presiding. After the usual discussion on the activities of the I past year, the secretary read the Financial Report, which showed a very satisfactory year.
Hie year. 1043, had been considered highly satisfactory with the purchase of $1.200. in Dominion of Canada Bonds, and c a sh ||||l|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||l 'creased over $100.00. However, the I follow ing will show 1944 as a record [in many respects, as compared with 11943 Gate receipts increased almost I$500.00, with an increase in donations of cash, labour and value, enabling the Board to meet an increase lin some current accounts, repairs, letc., and pay an increase of over I$400.00 in prizes, night show events land races; also to purchase Dorn, of ICan. Bonds for $1200.00 and have an (increase of cash on hand of over $200.00. Thanks for good attendance and donations.
I There was a lively discussion on prospects of improving the Fair.
All agreed prizes must be increased and some building necessary, if practical.
Mr. N. A. Drummond. Agronomist, was called upon, and expressed his appreciation of a good Shawville Fair and other doings of the Society, Iffi and explained many ways the farmer 1(1 could receive information and assistance from the Provincial and Federal Departments of Agriculture.
Proceeding to the election of Directors, some past members were left off. without being replaced, and five change- were made.
After the annual meeting, the Directors met and elected officers for the ensuing year. Mr. Hurst Hod-gins was re-elected president; also all vice-presidents, and R. W. Hod-gins was again chosen secretary-treasurer.
Resolutions were passed selecting the Midway committee and other committees.
The active discussion of many subjects brought up at the annual meeting and the directors meeting bespeaks early action for a bigger and better Fair in 1945.
R. W. Hodgins Secretary.

Letter of Appreciation
The following letter has been received by Mr. J. H. Murray, secretary of the local branch of the Brit-| ish and Foreign Bible Society, in appreciation of the substantial contribution to the Society by Shawville I and district friends.
I Mr. J. H. Murray,
I Shawville, Que.
Dear Mr. Murray:—
I Your contribution received and we were thrilled by the magnificient I piece of work which Shawville has done for the Bible Society.
Certainly no branch in our Auxiliary has carried through a canvass more efficiently than the friends in Shawville have and I want to thank you and Dr. Bowles for the time and thought you have given to it hope you will pass on to the contributors and collectors, as you may have opportunity, the warmest thanks of the Bible Society, which can scarcely find words to express its over-flowing gratitude.
The amount received was $440.90.
With all good wishes, I remain,
Yours very sincerely,
B. V. McLean.
District Secretary
We have recently taken over repairs for the McCormic-Deering Farm Implements, and will carry a heavy assortment of parts. We would advise owners of I.H.C. machines to bring in a list of their requirements for 1945, and we will try and secure them at an early date.
To the main users of North Star Poultry and Hog Feeds you may still place your orders through the Shawville Chick Hatchery; through our representative. Mr. John Howard, or by telephone direct to Ottawa Valiev Grain Products, Limited.
Red Cross Campaign
In an c»fticial announcement of the annual Red Cross fund-raising appeal lor 1945. which will continue from March 5 to 21. Mostyn Lewis and Rene Perrault, co-chairmen of the Red Cross campaign in Quebec Province, have urged Canadians everywhere to “uphold your enviable record of benevolence by making th campaign an overwhelming success*. The quota for the province wide appeal, part of a national campaign for $10,000.000. has been set at $2,250,000.
“This year the responsibilities of the Canadian Red Cross have in-1 creased considerably." the co-chairman pointed out. “We have been informed that over 17.000.000 persons iire in acute want and destitution in the United Nations, and we feel that our fellow Canadians would want us to make a practical expression of our .gratitude for the fortitude and courage displayed by these people dur-jng the bitter years of occupation.
“In previous years the Canadian Red Cross has included in its annual budget $1.000.000 to supply Allied civilian victims with médecines, vitamins and milk products, and a quantity of food parcels for prisoners of war.
“In October. 1944. the Dominion Government asked your Society if it would colaborate with the Canadian United Allied Relief Fund organization representing eleven war charities relieving distress in the United Nations, in a National Appeal. The basic idea was to avoid having two financial campaigns and also utilize to the fullest the vast machinery of the International Red Cross in bringing practical and speedy aid to those people in such dire need.
“Under the arrangements made with the Canadian United Allied Relief Fund, and aproved by the Dominion Government we have increased our budget quota for aid to allied relief to take care of the quired needs of the eleven nations; and the Department of National War Services, through its Advisory Committee. will fix the amounts to be devoted to assistance for each coun-
Thc spending of these amounts will be left in the hands of the Canadian Red Cross in consultation with a representative of each national group. The goods bought will be | shiped to the national Red Cross '' Society in the country to benefit, and distribution will be undertaken by the Red Cross. The cases shipped.
• however, will carry an identification label of the war charity organization in Canada, in addition to the Red Cross emblem.
Deliveries will be made through the Shawville Milling Company

PREPARING POULTRY FOR MOST PROFIT
- The attractive appearance of a well packed box of of accident, measure of art and the exercise of exacting care throughout a chain of activities. So much so, that even when the greatest pains have been taken in the feeding, fattening, killing, dressing, and packing, the fine bloom and sales’ appeal of the poultry may have been spoiled if correct methods had not been adopted in processing and pre-cooling. Clean boxes neatly stencilled and of correct size should always be used.
To assist farmers and all conected with the poultry industry in turning out the best product, the Dominion Department of Agriculture has revised and published the publication on “Standard Methods for the Preparation of Market Poultry publication has several illustrations and deals with killing and bleeding, cup and head weights, plucking, cleaning and flushing, pre-cooling, head wrapping, selecting birds for packing, and packing, lining, and stencilling the boxes, with a note on frozen storage. A copy of the publication may be obtained by writing to Dominion Department of Agriculture, Ottawa.

Wood Coated With Wax *9
Will Check Warping
$1.25
Evening Prayer
When the front door swells, the bureau drawers stick, the dining table warps, and the ironing board bulges, blame the weather, say wood experts. Wood, especially unfinished wood, absorbs moisture from the air in warm, humid weather and swells. While the wood is swollen, not much can be done except to ease tight places by rubbing with wax. But later when heat has dried out the house and brought the wood back to normal size, coat the underside of tables and other unfinished wood surfaces with varnish or wax to prevent the wood from taking in so much moisture again.
i The bulged board that adds to homé ironing difficulties is a problem to many homemakers. Ironing boards arc usually unfinished, and kept in damp laundries or kitchens, In ironing, steam from damp clothes is driven down into the wood. Wood experts advise buying a thoroughly seasoned board at least an inch and a half thick, because thick wood warps less than thin, and giving it several all-over coats of good spar varnish. Cleats of hard wood nailed to the underside of the board help to hold it flat. Keep the board in a dry place.
Does it cost more for this freshness ?
For the Bedroom
Definitely not! SHL'R-GAIN feeds are manufactured locally and for that reason they cost less. Extra transportation charges and middlemen s profits arc eliminated and this shows up in the price of the feed.

Traits of Quail
The Mearns Quail, which occurs in semi-arid lands of the southwest, probably had its original home in tropical forest, according to Dr. Loye Holmes Miller, professor of biology emeritus cn the Los Angeles campus of the University of California.
* Dr. Miller, who recently made a study of the bird, reports that it has a number of characteristics, such as large eyes, which suggest it evolved under forest conditions. ,The nature of certain of its muscles are similar to those of the tinamou of El Salvador.	i
The bird also bears closer structural resemblances to the forest quail with which it is associated in the southwest.
Curiously, many of the habits which probably developed in the tropics also serve the quail well in its present habitat. It is able to gather food in the dim light of early dawn, and it can rise explosively to seek cover in broken desert country when flushed by man or one of its I The Village of Shawville, Pontiac natural enemies.

Religious Testimony
On the night of December 16—in the dimly-lit parlors of Mexican families, where the Nativity is represented in a warm setting of evergreen, Spanish moss and colored paper lanterns, the entire family gathers 'round and begins the recitation of the Rosary, interspersed with songs to the Holy Child. Following this a children's procession bearing images of St. Mary and St. Joseph, and lighted candles, passes through the different rooms of the house and the patio. The few remaining people in the parlor sing the Litany of the Virgin to which the procession responds with the “Ora pro nobis.’/ As the Litany closes the procession stops before the closed doors of the parlor, those of the procession taking the part of the travelers and those with in representing the innkeepers.

He seemed surprised at her persistence; he answered with a shrug, shutting the door on her.
“Look like? Oh, like a dead man!” and he gave his own address to the taxi-driver. The girl, peeping out of the back window at him, fell a ueer tightening about her heart.

Teddy Banks had been losing money since he won his wager and forced the indignant Tandon to pay up.

Nevertheless, he got the money, because under his grandfather's will, lie had a right to a fairly large income, paid quarterly.

in stormy weather last week Partner and I got ourselves a job of real hard work, lasting for two whole Jays. It was no less than wrecking our square piano. A black piano that had long $incc become a white elephant. There was no other way of getting rid of it. It wasn't worth giving away; no junk dealer would take it in its entirety; its case was of no particular value and none of its “insides" could be used for repair work on any other type of piano.

“V\ lie's the man?"
Pam blushed furiously; for the twentieth part of a second she hesitated; she had a terrible remembrance of Fosdick's “Byram,” and Mark's reply. But she had no hint of its real significance.
"it's Stewart Byram. Don’t you remember him at dinner that time, Uncle Herbert? The tall fellow with —with the different look?" ¦
"1 seem to remember quite a number of tall fellows with different looks," Burleson replied, mus-

“That's my business,'* lie replied sharply; then, seeing her face fall, he qualified it. “It's not transferable; a friend gave it to me long ago. Besides, i+'s unlucky; you needn't covet in!"
His sharpness alarmed her; she peeped at him as they parted to pass through a crowd at the corner. He looked at lier shrewdly, and knew he had frightened her.
“I'm sorry," he said, more considerately, "ask something else, Para. You can't have that bit of jade! Before 1 die I'm going to smash it.”
"I wish you'd tell me all about it, then! she pleaded. -
"1 expect to tell the Angel Gabriel," lie said, "but no one else.”

This piano, you may remember, occupied a big corner of the room we moved into when we went “south". So imagine the state of our bedroom for two whole days. Almost the first thing Partner did was to unstring the instrument. Have you ever examined the works of a piano? Have you noticed how-taut are the wires and how each

Lggs and cheese are good companions and, as with most good companions, they have many things in common.

Cover baking dish and allow the mixture to become thoroughly chilled before baking. (This is necessary to make the Puffit puff). Set in pan of hot water and oven-poach in a moderate oven 350eF, until set. about 45 minutes. Six to eight servings.

The day after Pam lunched with Maik happened to he quarter day and Teddy Banks called a taxi and drove down into the swarming street where Fosdick’s hive rose imposingly. He found the old lawyer in his usual mood; he looked Teddy over with his lizard eye.
“You’ve been gambling again,” he remarked dryly, “drinking, too, I should imagine from your eyes. Of course you’re after money." “I'm broke,” he admitted cheer-stony broke!”
“Humph!* Fosdick began to turn over some papers. He had no valid excuse for holding up the legacy, but he wished he had. He despised the young man heartily* there was nothing in Teddy’s make-up that appealed to him. “I suppose you're in debt, too, as usual?” he snapped.

My job was dissecting the keyboard and in so doing 1 made several discoveries. Haven't you often wondered what makes piano keys come up again directly your fingers release them—or worse still, why. sometimes, they don’t. Well, 1 can give you the answer. Away at the end of each key is a tiny brass spring which controls the action of the key. And of course you know what happens when a spring becomes weak or breaks. Really, it was quite fascinating, this job. In fact it seemed almost a crime to deliberately destroy the marvellous and instricate workmanship that had gone into the making of this aged piano. Dear knows how much glue was used, for glue was everywhere. Not one nail did we find anywhere; nothing but screws, wooden pegs, brass pegs—and glue. And yet, with all

“Look !" she said softly you see that tall man getting into ; the bus? See, he's had to wait for that old woman and the child to go first. He doesn't see us — that's Stewart By ram."
It was a moment before Burleson found the young man in the crowd at the curb stepped up and began to climb to the top of the bus. Seen in profile thus, his face showed clean-cut and pale. Burleson studied it.
