There exists no magic wand one can use to waft military forces from flic scenes of battle to their normal home surroundings overnight. Unfortunately, long after the enemy cries surrender, the cost of war goes on.
The Canadian people must meet the cost of bringing the troops home, the maintenance of our forces of occupation in Germany. Pay of the men who are waiting demobilization goes on. Cheques to dependents keep going out until the sold ier has his discharge paper.
There are heavy domestic expenditures, made heavier by the unprecedented demands of this period of
reconstruction in the country, which are included in the totaJ of the Ninth Victory Loan objective-Hut of this we can be sure. The major portion of the money which Canadians will provide for the purchase of bonds in October and November is nrrdrd to rover the cost of war.

Britain To Replace Merchant Ships

This newspaper, the New York Herald Tribune believes that the moral obligation which we owe to Great Britain and the special position which she occupies with respect to world trade rehablitation— which is of major importance to our own recovery—alike dictate that we should lean over backward to be liberal in the terms on which aid is extended.
f he hooks the Nazis burned were not only in German bonfires. More than 1.000.000 books destroyed by fire in German bombing raids on England, the British Library Association discloses of them in municipal libraries. Some 54,000 children’s books went up in flames, and thousands of special collections housed in the libraries are gone forever.

9.4% of Canada's total population During the war about 400,000 sons left farm* to enter the armed forces and war industry, some of whom may not go hack. Another factor in the farm population look is the fact that about 75.000 farmers are in the aging class of 00 or over, thus becoming prospective sellers of their lands.

STAR SNAPSHOT SERVICE
Canada’s entire contribution of $« • ,000,000 to the United Nations Belief and Rehabilitation Administration has been used sides, UNRRA spent considerable United States funds to purchase goods in C uiada. Much of this money has gone to Canadian farmers who have supplied UNRRA with vast quantities of wheat, seed, meat and dairy products than half the wheat sent to Europe since V-E Day has been Canadian, and this percentage will be kept up during the present crop year. At this rate there will he only about 100,000.000 bushels left on hand by next July. Consequently the Canadian Wheat Board has lifted the 14-bushel-an-acre limit on wheat deliveries. This should put an additional 15,000,000 bushels into the United Nations’ food basket.

Victory has been won in Europe

war costs tasks, and these new tasks bring new needs, so, total outlays and borrowing requirements will continue at high levels.
For instance, men in hundreds of thousands must be brought back to their homeland from overseas will take time because of shipping shortages and continuing operations in occupied areas. Meanwhile, they must be paid, fed, housed and cared for in a hundred-and-one different ways. This all costs money—large amounts of it.
Then, the wounded and the sick must restored to health; Veterans will be given a good start in civilian life; many will be trained for new jobs. War service gratuities and reestablishment credits will be paid. These and other rehabilitation outlays involve hundreds of millions of dollars.

HELPFVL INFORMATION FEEDING FALL PIGS

ANNOUNCEMENT
The ability to raise fall pigs is the final test of the successful hog feeder. Damp Quarters, over-crowding and the feeding of unbalanced rations are the usual causes of failure with fall litters. As pigs will withstand cold much better than they do dampness, dry, rommy, well-bedded quarters which are free from draughts and well ventilated are a necessity if fall pigs are to make the best use of feed consumed, says H. E. Wilson, Dominion Experimental Station, La com be. Alberta, where hog raising is a special study.
Suitable supplementary feeds along with the grain is probably the most important item in successful winter pig production. In planning feed mixtures for winter pigs it is well to keep in mind that the pig fed during the winter months is for the, most part grown under conditions which deprive it of the use of green forage and contact with the soil quently as the fall farrowed pig cannot help to balance his own ration, feeds rich in protein, minerals and vitamins must be added to farm

A definite 44ye»” is Firestone’* answer to the second question. Wilbur Shaw, the famous race driver, proved it when he drove Firestone tires 500 miles at an average speed of 100.31 miles per hour over the Indianapolis Speedway-equal to 50,000 miles of ordinary driving.
WHEN you can buy new tires depends largely on UNNRA demands and rationing authorities. But you can be sure that once Firestone is given the go-ahead signal our full production will be devoted to your needs. In the meantime, your nearby Firestone Dealer will gladly do everything he can to help make your tires a last. See him todav.

Hold on there kitty! That isn't milk and that isn’t a rational steak, either. It's a fake kitty, just a product of Brooklyn ingenuity.

Other people came and went. Mrs. Mason, with a patch of plaster on her forehead and a worried look on her kind face. She felt responsible for his broken ribs and collarbone and the crack on the head he’d got when the car hit the pig. and she uf^ed him over and over not to worry; he'd be taken care of and just as soon as he was strong enough they'd see that he

There was a sickening swerve and the car tottered on two wheels for a hreath before it roared down the shoulder and into the ditch, to end with a sickening, jolting crash and smashing of glass.
Mona Lee sat stunned for a minute, her stomach hurting, her neck twisted, the broken steering wheel still in her hands. Her hat was off and her lap was full of glass, and there was blood running into her eye, and her knees burned and stung. Slowly she got hack her breath, opened her taut fingers, looked around, though merely moving her head made her giddy.
The door on the other side was open and hanging at a crazy angle, and of Gary Tall man only his booted feet were visible, sticking up inside the car.



CHRONICLES oi GINGER FARM
And now and then Mr. Mason came in. Gary was very apologetic when the big sandy man towered over the bed. But Harvey Mason didn't seem to resent his presence.
This room he lay in belonged to Harvey Junior, so be had learned.
Adelaide Mason had a husky voice and slow gray eyes. Lying in the dark, with the spring breeze stirring the curtains, Gary could still see her eyes. Little dark blue rings around the irises, and her lashes had gold on the ends and made shadows on her checks. There was a peppery line of freckles across her nose, and her lips were lovely. She had nice clean bright hair.

Partner is home again! Three weeks since he went away so I need hardly tell you how glad we are to have him back with us once more. I am sure many of you have been through a similar experience and know exactly what 1 mean. You know what it means to live a divided life as it were — with your thoughts in one place and your work in another, getting done such jobs as you can between trips to the hospital, nad after each trip sometimes coming away hopeful and other times downhearted-Yes, Partner is home all right but it certainly seems strange when milking time comes around to have him staying in the house instead of going to the barn. He never thought that was possible before. However, he is able to be up and around most of the day and absolutely refuses to let us make an invalid of him. But like all convalescents he thinks he can do far more than his strength will really let him. The quickest way to settle an argument i> to let him find out for himself.

Mona Lee tried to open the door beside her, but it was sprung and would not move, so she climbed over the boy's legs and tried to straighten his body, flung across the running hoard, his head on the ground. His face was greenish gray and the skin had been scraped off his forehead, but lie was breathing thinly through his mouth. She remembered about spines and that you shouldn't lift an injured person, so she dragged some dry grass under his head and staggered back to sit down on the culvert till her head cleared a little.
Her ears were ringing so that she did not hear the truck coming till the brakes squealed right at her ears, and a man jumped down beside her.
"Good gosh, Mrs. Mason!" It Slim. Mona Lee began to cry
The older Mason daughter, Grace, came on Sunday. She was different. Her hair was black and her eyes were cold and indifferent. She wore too much lipstick and she had a husband who looked like a collar ad. His name was Oliver, he was in solid with a big petroleum concern.
Oliver asked him about football and about Mexico, and said he thought chances were darned slim flown there and anyway cheap Mexican crude was playing the
dickens with the oil business.

He decided that he didn't like Oliver, and his opinion did not change even when he saw Oliver in old fishing clothes.
Hut Adelaide was different, and Mrs. Mason was swell. She brought up trays herself and fed him custard with a spoon, when they wouldn't let him use his arm or lift his head. The hand was pi rple and felt like wood, lying on the cool counterpane. Mrs. Mason told him about her little boy, Phil, who had died when he was six.
"He would have been just vour age now. He'd have looked like you, I think. He was a year older than Harvey Junior — and three years older than Adelaide."
So Adelaide was twenty-one. Mrs. Mason told him that she had had four children in six years.
"They were all little at once — and then they all grew up at once — and now I'm left with nobody to mother." So she mothered calves and ranch hands and Gary falh man.

There isn't a doubt in the world that flowers for the sick are a kind and thoughtful gesture and in the past I doubt if anyone would speak against the practise, particularly for private room patients. Today there are few private patients. People who are really sick cannot afford to wait until a private room is available, so there are more ward patients than ever before from what I was able to see in Toronto, there is absolutely no room in a public ward for flowers for

What can be made from a man s worn out shirt? Six handkerchiefs are one thing, two from the front, four from the back. Out of it can instead appear a dress for the one to three year old. The dress front comes from the back of the shirt while the dress back is cut from the front of the shirt, putting the scam down the dress back. Sleeves and a little collar are cut from the shirt sleeves. With the addition of some gay embroidery or coloured ric-rac braid a pretty little dress emerges.

Kitchen Shower For Miss Howard

Clinton Palmer and Mrs.
Mrs.
Robt. Chamberlain entertained at a nicely arranged kitchen shower Wednesday afternoon at the home of the former, in honour of Miss Ella Howard, one of last week’s brides. _
The bride-to-be entered the living-room, which was decorated with pink and white streamers for the occasion.
After the address, which was read by Mrs. Grant Eades, four little girls presented the guest of honour with nicely decorated basket of gifts. Miss Howard thanked her friends for the lovely gifts. Dainty refreshments were served by the hostesses, assisted by Mrs. Grant Eades and Mrs. Percy Belsher.	i ,
* H. H. Hannam is President and Managing Director of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. In a message addressed to farmers, Mr. Hannam says:
"The farmer who is wise will look ahead and plan carefully.
"And in these years when prices and returns are more satisfactory than they have been, when labor is scarce, when farm machinery is restricted, when building materials are not readily available, a good course to follow would be that of putting a substantial share of the year’s earnings into sound securities such as Victory Bonds. These reserves will not only provide a measure of insurance against difficulties in less favorable years, but at such time when supplies are favorable and costs will probably be lower, their purchasing power will be greater and return from them correspondingly increased.
"We believe this is good planning from the farmer’s standpoint. At the same time, it is the very best of planning from the standpoint of the Nation.”

DDT Discovered by Scientist In Year 1874

C. R. Twinn, Division of Entomology, Science Service Department of Agriculture, gave a talk, “The Story of DDT”, to the National
Museum on Saturday morning, speaker told the interesting story of how this remarkable new insecticide, discovered by a young German scientist in 1874, and thought to be of no value, by a strange twist of fate was used by Allied armies in this war and German soldiers, badly affected by insects, did not receive treatment until they became prisoners of war.
Dr. Twinn told of the intensive study of the compound which was begun immediately by American and British scientists. Millions of lives in the armed forces were saved from malaria and typhus, carried by insects, especially in Burma and the Far East.	I
