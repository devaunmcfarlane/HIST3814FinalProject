All the bacon, beet and eggs that Canada can supply will be provided Great Britain in 1946 by an agreement signed in Ottawa by Hon. James G. Gardiner (left), Dominion Minister of Agriculture, and Col. the Hon. J H. Llewellin, British Minister of Food.




Commodore Worral fe. Carter, USN, above, of Norfolk, Va., heads hitherto unmentioned Service Squadron 10, floating miracle* of supply which serviced the Okinawa invasion. Consisitlng of hundreds of ships — ammunition, repair, floating dry docks, oilers, water tankers and thousands .of chanics—Squadron 10 follows the fleet, eliminates necessity of fixed land bases.

Accorded a very definite stamp of approval by ove 60,000 Canadian youth from coast to coast, "Sports College', a Y.M.C.A. and CBC jointly sponsored project offering free athletic direction and physical fitness instruction, gives Canada the distinction of having the largest organization of its kind in the world. The idea, born in the mind of a teen age Canadian boy athlete 14 years ago and kept alive dispite discouragement came to a sausiying fruition in the recent Nation-wide contest when over 34,000 entries shattered all previous program response records. This boy, once called, "Canada's Moat Versatile Athlete ", is Lloyd Percival, now Head Coach of, “Sports College ", and whose greeting, “Hello Fellows" ... is heard over a network of 36 stations every Saturday. The weekly gathering for coaching instructions is only one phase of the project. When a boy writes to “Sports College,"" Box 99, Toronto, for his free membership card and a handsome sweater crest he immediately becomes eligible for any or all of a constantly growing library of booklets and bulletins on physical conditioning and diet and a "how to play " series covering all popular Canadian games and sports events, sent free upon request. Seated around the table microphones are, left to right, Bill Bessey, announcer; Head Coach Lloyd Percival; Keith Cruickshank the winnner and Bob Lcadingham, of Indian Head, Sask., the runner-up in the recent “College ' contest. During their stay in Toronto they #were guests on the regular Saturday, “Sports College,” broadcast.

Map above shows Bavarian Alps area of southern Germany where top Nazi leaders expect to hold out, according to their secret “Plan K," uncovered by noted author Curt Riess in a daring trip into unoccupied Germany. He reports that 100,000 picked troops are already in the Réduit. Nazi big shots, according to Riess, have already moved into the hideaways indicated on map. The escape plan is said to be of long standing, but decision to put it into operation, wtih a zero hour set, was made at a meeting of Hitler, Himmler and Wehrmacht general# at Berchtesgaden on March 29.

OUT OF OUR ABUNDANCE
This is our Eighth Victory Loan.
Year after year we have subscribed with varying emotions. There were days when we did so, feeling almost that we were paying for life and liberty. Now we are asked to subscribe when we have a confident knowledge that victory is sure and not too distant.
There is encouragement in that change, but there is also ground for sober thought. As we come to victory, the tempo and the destructiveness of war increase. With that
increase there is a growing cost
a cost in dollars that we can afford;]well watered, good outbuildings
a cost in young lives that it is impos-
This youth that
live days after Renfrew

In our school books we learned that—“for want of a nail the shoe was lost—for want of a shoe, the horse was lost—for want of a horse the battle was lost."
Yes, often something that seems relatively small is the hinge upon which a major event hangs. Today, we all desire that our boys overseas shall return home quickly—but it is only by every one of us doing the utmost in our power that this desire will become an accomplishment.
The 8th Victory Loan is here. Let every one of us lend our money, so that our boys may come home sooner.

Canadian communities interested in post-war planning also have a valuable ally in the National Film Board Rural Circuits. Films on rehabilitation programs, youth centres or town planning provide a helpful means of presenting information and encouraging group discussion on these matters. Already several communities have held conferences on such post-war problems as unemployment, agricultural readjustment and housing. To assist in projects of this sort, the National Film Board is prepared to supply both films and the services of its field representatives to screen them.

POULTRY MEAT IN A RGENT DEMAND
Never before in Canada was there such a favourable market for poultry meat as now. Every pound that can be produced this year, preferably Grade A and Grade B. will find a ready market at ceiling or very near ceiling prices. In addition to the agreement under which the United States Government will take up to 30,000.000 pounds from the Special Products Board there is a ready demand for good quality poultry meat on the domestic market. The United States Government requires for its army chickens of two pounds or over and fowl 2 b pounds and over. Cockerel chicks should be raised for food. Grade C birds are not wanted to choke the market. They never were profitable to the farmer and are not so now.
The best and quickest way to raise birds for the top grades is by efficient management a n.d proper feeding. Any agricultural representative or experimental farm will gladly advise farmers on these points.
There is a world shortage of the heavier meats— beef, pork, lamb.
The poultry producers of Canada can help relieve the situation by producing top quality birds for meat. And the most profit is in Grades A and B birds.
The demand for poultry meat will be active for some time to come both at home and abroad and so will the market for eggs.
At this time ,when the world needs food so urgently, the challenge is clear to Canadian farmers with poultry. Produce more birds of the best quality. By doing this they will help feed the hungry and make jnoney doing so.

According to figured release, last week, the publicly-owned synthetic rubber plant in Sarnia iu February hit a new high in the production of synthetic rubber with a total of 8.770,000 pounds— approximately 115 percent of the designed capacity of the plant.
An average of 315.000 pounds a day was produced in that record breaking month. This large .out put, maintained for a year b> Polymer Corporation would result in an annual production of about 105,000,000 pounds of syntheti: rubber.
SPRAINS
Pulled muscles and sprains are being robbed of their serious and painful features by treatments which formerly were employed by those who were concerned with the care of Olymphic show that soldiers, who have been treated, are able to return to duty almost immediately and their injuries heal while they work, says The Saint John Telegraph-Jounral.
The quick cure consists in applying a spray of ethyl chloride to the injured area's surface and encouraging immediate motion of the part instead of wrapping it in a paster cast or adhesive tape and immobilizing it. The chemical provides surface anaesthesia to the area, quickly relieves pain and enables the patient to move the injured part. Supervised motion improves circulation and prevents stiffness and swelling.
While formerly used only on athletes, the treatment is giving good results in the armv and it is expected that after the war it will be used generally where painful sprains and strained muscles might be a handicap.

CHAPTER XVIII
Fo&dirk went to Burleson's office the next day in a rare puzzle. He had been called up at home the sight before and told to find Mark Grant and tell him to meet him there.
Burleson met him calmly enough. "Sit down,” he said laconacally, and then: "You got Grant, you say? Well, he's late."
Fosdick grinned, lie ddin't want to come.”
Burleson nodded. "Very likely!" Then he pushed a broken green jade head, bearded and saturnine, toward the lawyer. "Keep that, Fosdick; you’ll need it."
Fosdick picked it up and looked It over curiously; he was beginning to think that his friend's mind was affected. "Health's had enough," he thought; “got water on the brain, I’ll bet a dollar!" But he put the jade god's head down with a gingerly touch.
"1 remember. Used to sejuat on your table. How did you break it ?"
Burleson looked at it bleakly; he was gray as ashes today. "I smashed it. Temper. Fosdick, once in awhile I break out. It's rotten, but it's a fact. It’s the second time I've pitched that accursed jade god; 1 wish I'd smashed it to begin with! "
"Humph!” Fosdick poked it with Lis long hony forefinger. "Where did you get it anyway?"
"Grant Barton gave it to me."
* *» $
"Eh?" The old lawyer straightened up, suddenly his eyes met the
hollow eyes opposite and he felt a qualm of dismay. What the deuce did it mean? Then lie heard a door open and looked around. A clerk was showing Mark Grant into the sanctum. Fosdick stared at young man with a feeling that he could not define; it certainly could not be admiration for a criminal, or even toleration, yet he had to ad-reluctantly — that Mark's very presence in the room was like a rush of fresh air in a choking atmosphere. There was something in his size, in his clean-cut face and clear eyes, that was reassuring; his guilt never appeared upon the surface.

2. Is it necessary that a house guest always consult the hostess before accepting some outside invitation?
it. If a divorcee retains her husband’s surname how should -lie be known?
4.	When a couple are engaged to be married, is one ever invited to some social affair without inviting the other?
5.	When walking with a woman who is carrying an umbrella, -hould a man offer to hold it for her:

1. No. She can order and pay for the dinner in advance, or pay at the table when the dinner is finished. 2. Yes. 3. By her given name, her family name, and her married name, as: "Mrs. Mary Jones Wilson." 4. It is customary to invite both, unless it is impossible for one of them to attend. 5. Yes. 6. Oranges, peaches, pear's, apples, bananas, plums, and grapes.
Burleson, too, was studying the newcomer, and no one spoke until Mark broke the silence.
"You sent for me."
Burleson nodded. "Sit down," he said in a voice that struck Fosdick at once as singular; he around at him sharply.
"Thank you; I'll stand. Ini going out of town almost at once," Mark retorted shortly. Then his eye fell on the broken jade head on the desk and the blood leaped into his face. "Is it about that?" he asked quickly.
"Yes,"
"you're right about it; 1 could have cleared you; your uncle gave that to me after you'd left him."

Mark's face hardened
"I was
sure of it! You’ll state that now, Mr. Burlesonr"
Yesterday I called at the newly Installed frigid locker plant In our nearby town. Opening our own locker 1 took out two frozen packages of meat and took them home. They were already for the oven yet we had no part In the preparatory work of the meat. We had neither butchered, made the sausage or cured the hams. And I thought as I drove home how greatly living conditions have changed for nearly all farm people.
A hundred years ago—or even fifty, farm folk prided themselves on their self-sufficiency. On nearly every farm butchering was part of the winter's work. Farm women baked their own bread, churned their own butter, carded their own wool, later making it Into homespun blankets and heavy clothing. Delivery of goods was almost unheard of—except for the occasional travelling salesman.
Yet with all the hard work and lack of conveniences large famil-
the fellow intends running a plant for custom killing?"
"Maybe," answered Partner, "But I know one thing—If we can't pick our own chickens we'll quit raising them."
Well, that was Partners reaction, mainly, I suppose, because the idea wae new. R en at that, there might be a time when we shall be only too glad to take advantage of Just such a plant.
Burleson smiled oddly. "That's why I sent for you. I ran do more than that," — he paused an instant, staring in front of him — then he went on coldly; "your uncle gave it to me. After that we quarreled. You know the things Grant Barton said when he was angry? He said too many of them; I lost my temper and flung the jade god in his face. It struck his temple killed him instantly."
"Good God!" Fosdick’s violent surprise made him collapse in his chair, hut neither Mark nor Burleson flinched.
"I always felt you knew something,” Mark said bitterly; "and you let me suffer!"
"1 let tilings go!"
damp, go over them gently with a damp cloth, and it will leave no •pots.
Q. How can I save time when cleaning the bird cage?
A. Cut eight or ten thicknesses of Heavy white paper and place at the bottom of the canarys cage Every morning a sheet can be removed, leaving a nice clean floor his will save much cleaning of the cage.

Certainly while the labour shortage must still be contended with, the more one can get done with outside help the better. And perhaps after the war, when home freezing units become a part of many farms, home butchering will stage a comeback. Personally. not being a descendant of pioneer farming stock. I am well content to let someone else wrestle with pigs' heads, sausage making and ajl the fuss and muss that goes with butchering. Hut then I'm a lazy farmer’s wife. I admire the skill and hard work that goes Into these jobs but I don't want to do them myself. No sir, after twenty-five years of doing my share at pretty nearly everything there is to do on a farm I am all for the soft spots—that is after the war. That is why I am so glad there is some hope of getting hydro at last. However, getting the hydro Is one thing—getting things to work with Is something else again. Has anyone got a washing machine in cold storage? If so 1 would be very glad to warm it up once a week. Right now my electrical equipment is limited to an iron and a pair rf curling tongs. That is about on a par with the time 1 was married when all I had In my “hope chest" was a pair of stockings and a meat grinder.

Well, the weather has turned warm again and once more we are thinking about spring work. Last week when it was so cold we thought we were back to winter again. One morning i went out and found the daffodil buds absolutely stiff with frost and the flowers that were in bloom flat on the ground. I thought that was the end of them. To my surprise it wasn’t. The flowers perked right

Now, in spite of modern conveniences around the home, the majority of farm foks are almost as dependant upon outside help as anyone in the city. We pay to have work done which was formerly regarded as part of the day’s work. We pay to have butchering done; we store the meat in lockers instead of the old brine barrel. We pay for processing and smoking, in fact all we do for ourselves is cook the meat and eat It. And, in regard to other provisions, in many districts bread, groceries and butter are delivered right to our door.

The decision to give Princess Elizabeth a commission in the A.T.S. a<# a second subaltern, with the intention of being trained as an officer-driver, is in seeping with the admirable plans the King and Queen have made for the Princess' education throughout, comments the London Spectator.
But it is, of course, much more than that, for since she reached her 16th birthday last April, Princess Elizabct! has been in a position to make her own decisions, and there can he no doubt that this is one of them. The Princess has hern an active, and indeed ardent, member of the Sea-Scouts, and it was inevitable that she should wan* to identify herself in some way with the war service ir. w#ch so many hundreds of thousands o; her future subjects of her own age are engaged.
And though there is, so far as I know, no precedent for such activities on the part of an English princess, certainly of an English princess who is heir-presumptive, Princess Elizabeth is in fact doing in the Army just what her father and grandfather did in the Navy.

Burleson nodded coldly. "Granted! But a man doesn't think clearly in such a case at once. I was horror stricken, naturally; was going to call a doctor, hut I felt of him — he was stone dead! It was the most amazing thing; it knocked me out." He leaned back in his chair, passing his hand quickly over his face.
