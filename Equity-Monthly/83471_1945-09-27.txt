Saturday’s show featured competitions for special prizes and it was noted that entries were heavier than in Friday’s program, and appeared to hold the interest of the crowd around the show ring to a greater degree. In view of this, the writer wonders if the Directors of this section of the Fair would not do well to interject some special show ring features for Friday, other than for only Society prizes.
The horse races, both Friday and Saturday, were very interesting and Fair were run off without accident or injury to anyone. Mr. W. J. Suther- with dances in up-town halls, and land, the well-known and popular were packed to capacity.

Caille production in Canada has atwayj been limited, by'fhe fact that production costs are higher than "in Southern hemisphere countries, especially Argentina, Brazilaud Australasia. For this reason, Canada has not, in the past, been a hit :to compete in the open Beef markets of the world. The chief open market has
been Great Britain.	'	’ ~

To meet the anticip;it^lrlt«>v<Mlftiry losses,each war year a sum has been set asme is Wartime inventory Reserve. That sum for the year under review was $581,000.00.

However, though excluded from the open markets^ Canada Iras had a mesure of preference in the duet'protected market, viz. United States. To that country, until wartime controls diverted the flow, Canada shipped about 200,000 Cattle yearly. And her production of Cattle was regulated roughly to meet Canadian domestic requirements, plus the.000,000 head shipped to United States.	7	;

The first, and paramount duty of the Industry was that it manage to process the greatly increased deliveries of Live Stock. That this was not a simple matter, is evident from the following comparison of inspected slaughterings for the years 1944 arid. 1939:—

Substantial extensions in plant were, of course, necessary; but in the main the handling of the increased deliveries was achieved by ‘adjustments’, especially by increase in numbers of personnel and of shifts. Proof that the job was effectively done lies in the * fact that only in two short periods throughout the 5% vtarL was the flow of Live Stock sidled up, due fb congestion at the plants.
