British Get Less Food That Needy May Have More

!
London's “temporary' Waterloo Bridge that was used for seventeen years until the permanent Waterloo Bridge was opened in 1942, now spans tin Rhine at R«-magen.
It was dismantled and shipped across the Channel after the capture of Antwerp in readiness for an emergency.
a
Its time came when Keinagen Bridge — at that time the Allies’ only bridge across the Rhine — collapsed soon after it had been taken by U. S. troops. Special trucks rushed the dismembered bridge to Kemagen, section by section, and army engineers worked night and day under enemy fire to rebuild it over the Rhine.

Life has been exceedingly tough for British civilians throughout five years of w.ir, says the Minneapolis Star Journal. It will be tougher as regards both food and clothing before it gets better because of continuing shortages. There would he more to eat and more to wear for the British n they curtailed the war effort against Japan or shut their eyes to the misery of the liberated peoples of Europe. The British will do neither.
With commendable altruism the British are making plans to get along without further clothing and other relief from the United States in order that needier European liberated peoples may receive the fullest possible measure of American assistance.
The British War Relief, whicn during the past five years has contributed $50,000,000 to tons, will terminate its activities October 1. By British request funds raised in the national war fund campaign next Autumn will be utilized for sufferers on the continent while the United Kingdom will care for its own needy without American assistance.

Hail and Farewell!
It would be impossible to bid good-bye to all of you personally, but we cannot leave without expressing to you our deep appreciation for the kindly co-operation and gracious hospitality you have extended to us since we came here almost three years ago.
We wish to especially thank the girls in central for their unfailing patience and helpful assistance. The Bank staff also were outstanding with their courteous efficient service.
Our stay here was made very pleasant by the cheerful co-operation of all with whom the company has business relationships.
We will always follow the adventures and achievements of your “big little town” with deep interest. Your very generous parting gift leaves us feeling very humble.
Our best wishes for the future remain with you.
Thanks again for everything,
Jack and Isobel Stavenow.

A humorous reading, entitled “Dorothy Dumb’s Organ Recital”; an interesting and very instructive “Question Box”, and the singing of a favourite song, brought the program to a close.
