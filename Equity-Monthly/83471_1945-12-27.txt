CHAPTER XI
At dusk Gary and Adelaide returned Ironi another trip over into the oil fields» atid Mona Let noted how sober Gary’s face was. He handed her a sheaf of paper». "Will you put these away carefully, Mn. Mason,'till Mr. Maso» comes back?”
Mona Lee looked at the figures. "My gracious, Gary, does an oil well cost as much as that? That's more than Harvey makes in a year!”
“Think how much he'll make when we get oil, Mother," Adélaïde said
“If he get» oil," Gary added.
“Still croaking, arc you?" remarked Adelaide coldly. "But 1 can't blame any oil man for having a nasty disposition. If you'd see the way they have to live, Mother ven the ones that have fairly nice houses—and most of them don't. They have little, dreadful pU.ce», stuck around under derricks
by a languid, long-tailed dog.
Every dog’s tail tlmmpvd like a signal drum on the wooden floor as they drove up to the gate, and from within the house a woman's voice called nasally, "Pa, here comes somebody!"
Harvey and Gary waited on the porch, surveyed with weary indifference by the flat eyes of the dogs. Then old man Harper came to the door.

Dear friends and patient leaders everywhere: You are busy and I busy but I think we can just lake time out for \ few minutes to exchange Christmas greetings, don't you? Naturally I want to wish everyone of you a very Happy Christmas an 1 since this is a season of goodwill 1 am going to take it for granted that that is also your wish for us at Ginger Farm.

And then let u» remember tlie
everywhere. Children and Christmas belong together. If you have little ones in your home then you are to he envied. Make them happy—it takes so little. Don't spoil them with extravagant giving but make *t their day in other ways. Join in their fun; share their laughter, make this a Christmas for' them tv remember. And it there are no children in your home there are plenty outside of it.
Jt may he a cjueer notion on my part but I always have a feeling that there can he little happiness in our own hearts unless we have contributed in some way towards» the happiness of at least one little boy or girl at Christmas tiin:, other than ’those of our own family.

Pour into a moistened ring mould and chill until firm. Unmould on salad greens and fill centre with cabbage salad. Six servings.

This pudding requires more mincemeat than pie, therefore is luscious and juicy but easy on the shortening.

Sift together the dry ingredients. Cream the shortening slightly, add sugar and egg. Blend well. Add dry ingredients alternately with milk, to make a rather thin drop batter. Decorate- the bottom of a well-greased pudding mould with a few toasted almonds. Spread with a generous layer of* mincemeat. Fill mould no more than two-thirds full with batter. Cover and steam over rapidly boiling water, about 1 Ya hours. Turn out and serve hot with hard sauce or a hot pudding sauce. Six servings.

"It’s not about the note. If you ain't able to pay it—or maybe pay all of it, we can fix that up. Whit I want to talk about is me running a pipe down here through your pasture and pumping a little water out of that creek. What you figure you'll 'charge me for running the pipe line, and the water?"

season is a tradition of long standing, so we gather our families, our friends, and those for whom we are making Chrismas, to share the happiness of the day.
The home economists of the Consumer Section, Dominion Department of Agriculture, offer a few suggestions to simplify some of the homemakers’ problems.
In keeping with the Christmas colour scheme the salad should be
Tradition makes us expect there will be a ctrtaii amount of giving ard getting, but in that 1 often feel we have lost sight of the original idea behind tin's exchange of gifts. We seem tj be leaning towards a tendency to bpend more and more each year on the presents we buy for our friends. I am afraid we too often forget that gifts are meant as an expression of our thought foi one another—not as a blatant display of spending power. Haven t we all had the experience some time or oth:r of being cheered and touched by a simple and inexpen sivc present from an unexpected quarter? If that be so, then isn’t it safe to assume that we also can give pleasure in the same way? We c;n no more buy a happy Christmas by extravagent giving than we can buy our way into the Kingdom of Heavei mas or at any other time, for that matter, is reflected in our own hearts in proportion to our will to bring happiness to the lives of others.
“That’s where we'll be stuck I suppose," sighed Mona Lev.
Harvey Mason came back, very jubilant, with his driling permit in
his pocket.
“Had to finagle some of those guys," he admitted. "Railroad Commission thinks there are too many wells down now—but I got around ’em."
"I’ll bet you paid somebody plenty.** Mona Lee dashed his exuberance.
"Just paid my lawyer. Permit didn't cost anything."
“Hadn’t we better see about the water before vç go any further?" Cary asked. "There’s no use moving drillers ou to this job, till we ’re sure about the water."
"Ought not to have any trouble about that." Harvey was bland.
* I’ve loaned old man Harper plenty—got a chattel mortgage on all his stock and tools now. Mortgage ain't due till August—but he can’t pay it and he knows it."

Last but not least we should surely remember the reason for which Christmas came into being. “For unto us a Child is bcrn Without that thought to guide us Christmas is meaningless and void. Remember it, and Christmas giving, Christmas fare, thought for the children, our own little personal problems, our joys and our sorrows, fall into their right perspective and we can say in all sincerity —"A Happy Christmas to you all!"
Old Harper did not look up, but there was about his mouth a sly and contemptuous twist. “Don't figure to charge ye nothing. Harvey."	y
red. The choke is between cranberries, tomato juice and beets. A jellied salad will be the easiest to prepare and serve, since it requires only garnishing with greens and dressing at the last minute.
Dessert will probably be plum pudding or mince pie, but it is wise to have an alternative dessert for the children and those who may have already indulged rather heartily in the first course time homemade vanilla custard ice cream served with a red fruit sauce i# just right.	\
"Well, I'll pay whatever the damages come to."
"Don’t figure to charge you nothing," Harper went on in a maddening drawl, "because I don’t figure to let you have any water, because I’ve leased every doggone acre of this place to some fellers down in Corpus Christi. And if there's any more water in that creek than what my cattle can drink, I reckon they’ll want it theirselvesr. They're paying me twenty dollars an acre for ten years, and that’s more than 1 can make off’n a bunch of cows.’’
Harvey’s neck was red and his eyes glared. "Harper," he said, 1 sure wish that note was due right now. I’d foreclose and sell you out!"

And what about Christmas fare —does it contribute towards our enjoyment? At the risk of being thought .slightly gluttonous would say yes"—particularly with so many of our boys back from overseas. Ask these boys and you will soon find that Christmas dinner according to their own family tradition lias, to them, become a symbol. Don't try to change it— don't think to yourself "I won't bother making puddings this year" cakes, or whatever it is that has been your custom. If you do so slip up you take something away from Chrismas a» your family remembers it. No need to be extravagant—remember the starving millions in Europe—but use your imagination, your ingenuity, and make something that looks Ikie the real thing.

Thanks for a ‘Nice* _ Christmas Present
Sunday School Lesson

With Christmas close at hand the young man is likely to solve the ' gift problem'’ in an orthodox wav by visiting the florist or candy shop. Exhibits in the Royal Ontario Museum, however, show that r.if! the 18th century his lady love likely would have received a far more varied selection of presents, for instance, she might have been given a stay busk, which was a long flat piece of wood that women wore at that time tucked down inside the front of their bodices to add to the rigidity of the pr son-like corsets. There is a stay busk in the costume gallery of the Museum that is carved with two sets of initials and the date 1793.
An even more significant gift was a wooden spoon. There are some of these love spoons in the Museum that are beautifully caived and seem to suggest that in days gone by you had to be quite handy with a pocket knife before you could be a successful lover. The expression “spooning" comes from the way spoons fit closely together and this curious custom of giving a spoon grew out of that use of the word.

Let your tree be big or small, as you wish, but make it gay and sparkling. Bring out the gaudy baubles, the tinsel, the star and the Christmas angel, even though the ore it was your delight to trim the tree for in years gone by is no longer here to share it with you. You naturally feel you no longer have the heart for such pretense.

Washing Pretties, Makes • Curtains Last Longer
Washing is. not merely a matter of prettying the curtains. It is a means of making them last. The sheerer and more fragile your curtains are, the more necessary it is to protect them by washing them as soon as they need it.
Before putting curtains into cool sudsy water, loose dust should be shaken out. Let them soak for about 15 minutes, then squeeze out the blackened water and place in fresh lukewarm suds, either in the washer or tub. Run the washer about five minutes fur fragile curtains; eight or ten minutes for the more durable ones. Before going into the .washer, lacy curtains should be put into thin pillow slips so the agitator will not break fine threads. For hand washing, a light rubbing against the washboard or between the hands may be needed to remove all the grime. Rinse, starch lightly, and dry on a stretcher or by hanging evenly over the line, being sure tv square the corners.
Many curtain fabrics, especially those with a net or mesh weave, shrink during washing. This should be taken into consideration when they are purchased or made. If no such allowance has been made and the curtains have shrunk materially they can be re-lengthened by false-facing the top and bottom hems, or by adding fringe to the bottom hem, or by a bias fold of contrasting material.
25 FREE CHICKS
Editor The Equity:
Dear Sir—Thirty years ago I remember when 3 dozen eggs sold for 35 cts.; butter 10 cts per pound; milk was 5 cents a quart; the butcher gave away liver and treated the kids with bologna ; the hired girl received 2 dollars a week and did the washing; women did not powder and paint (in public) smoke, vote, play bridge or do the Charleston.
Men wore whiskers and boots and jchewed tobacco; butchers and others worked twelve hours a day and never went on strike; no tips were given to waiters and the hat-check grafter was unknown; a kerosene hanging lamp and a stelescope in the parlour were luxuries, no one was ever operated on for appendicitis or glands; microbes were unheard of; folks lived to a good ripe old age and walked every year miles to wish their friends a Merry Christmas!
To day. you know, the preacher iroadcasts over the radio: everybody rides in automobiles or flies, plays golf and bridge; plays the piano with their feet; goes to the movies nightly; smokes cigarettes, drinks beer and cocoa cola; blames the high cost of living on the government’s excessive expenditure; never go to • bed the same day they get up and think they are having a wonderful time.
These are the days of profiteering, excess taxes and politics and if you think life is worth while, I wish you Prosperity for 1946.
Yours.

of the mating pen is all-important.
Too often, this phase of the work is neglected with the result that improvements in flock quality is slow and disappointing, says B. F. Tinney,
Dominion Experimental Sta., Charlottetown,P.E.I.
All birds selected for breeding should have the general characteristics of health, alertness, vigour.
Slow, over-rat, sluggish birds should be discarded, so too should thin birds with pale combs, or those showing any evidence of white or pearly eye.
A clean-cut face and bright, prominent eye is a good indication of health and vigour and such birds should have preference.
In body type they should be broad with full round breasts. Flat or slabsided birds, also leggy and awkward gaited birds should be avoided.
Individual egg records if available assist in selection. Low producers should definitely be discarded also all birds that consistently lay small eggs. Individual high laying records are not a reliable measure of the worth of a bird breeder. A high producing female from a family of low producing sisters is not likely to go far in flock improvement, but a group of high producing sisters will in all probability produce daughters that wil prove their worth from an egg-laying standpoint.
As the male is half of the breeding flock especial care should be taken in his selection. He should be free from war period, many new uses for defects and abnormalties such as, luminous coatings already have been sprigs. stubbs and split wings. The developed and are expected to have head is the best single criterion of extensive application in improving •quality and in the male should show illumination in homes, factories, health and vigour as denoted by a stores, theatres and other structures, bright eye, and alert appearance and As an example of the development should be decidedly masculine in all 0f luminous materials, “Witcomb-

Far better is the use of admiration and constructive criticism to build the self-confidence which is psychologically important in the achievement of good bearing.

The remedy for this is physical exercise that will develop corre-I spending strength in the weaker I muscles.

Face Camouflage
Paint for -face and hand camouflage for soldiers has been standardized in nine colors: light green, dark green, sand, field drab, earth brown, earth yellow, loam, earth red, and olive drab. These tints of paint are put up in tubes and issued to soldiers in selected areas, with small booklets containing instructions for the use of the paint. The fundamental purpose is to overcome the conspicuous reflection of white skin and to obscure the face by the application of irregular blotches of paint. The colors used are determined by the prevailing colors of the environment in which the soldier is operating.

In building a typical fighter plane, the first plane to come from the production lines, Model "A," took
157.000	manhours to build.
Tenth plane of that model took
59.000	manhours. By that time the engineers were beginning to discover ways and means to improve the ship, so the 13th plane was a slightly revised model—Model “B”—which still took 59,000 manhours to build.
Despite design and model changes and changes In specifications, the 100th plane took only 26,500 manhours to build and the 1,000th, only 7,800 manhours.

EARLY CHICKS BRING THE greatest returns. Canada needs early chicks next year and always. She needs them not only to supply her own requirements but to sustain her export market at the time It needs eggs most. Any product Is better appreciated at home or abroad when it is sup-• Plied at the time It Is most needed. Early chicks have two advantages. 1st. — they lay early when prices are the highest: 2nd. — they lay longest spreading the returns over the whole year. Failure to secure sufficient early chicks last spring resulted In a shortage of eggs this Fall. Any surplus that may occur In the Fall of 1946 Is protected by the export contract with Great Britain which Insures a price of 45c. for a Large Seaboard. Send for our early delivery pricelist, you will not only make extra money with early hatched chicks, but you will save money by taking them early. Free catalogue. Also laying and ready to lay pullets for Immediate delivery. Tweddls Chick Hatcheries Limited, Fergus, Ontario.

A Catalina Hying Boat lies ditched in the Pacific after its death struggle with a Jap submarine. Its radio lias been destroyed, its water tanks punctured, and three of its crew killed, But the Cat still floats, and in it the two survivors, Alec Brooke, the young pilot from Iowa, and his navigator, Gene Mauriac of California, sweat out the hours as they wait for rescue.
Days of overcast—on one of which they see a plane that does not spot them—are succeeded by an endless stretch of brassy heat. They know they have drifted far out of range of Henderson Field, and as the hours pile up and the water runs low, Alec begins to reminisce about his home town in Iowa, about his sea-faring uncle, and about his boyhood dream of a tiny Pacific Island, an island marked “Existence Doubtful" on the old maps, an island toward which they might even now be drifting . . .

. The Ivan of $4,400,000,000 arranged last week by British representatives with the United States government has two features—an advance of $3,750,000,000 to Bri-lain, to be used to re-establish domestic economy, and $650,000,000 by way of a Lend-Lease balance. The essential aspect of tlve $4,400,000,000 loan is the good it çan do the two Countries (and the world) in setting up the basis for new trade agreements which will permit a tree flow of world-trade goods.
The major trade concessions made by Great Britain will work to the advantage of the United States, by opening up new markets to American industry and agriculture.
It is not inconceivable that these renewed markets will add more billions to the1 national income of the United States ,in one year than the amount of the loan.
In lighting the war, says the New York Sun, Great Britain entirely exhausted its working capital. The British still arc,in a strong petition a* business men all over the world They have the shops and an established reputation for j sound business dealings, but thev haven’t the goods with which io
•link ilieir shops.e
It is now proposed that we help them by supplying working capital.
If wc do so we can hope that the channels of world trade once more will be open to ourselves as well as to Great Britain and other nations.
If world trade cannot be established in . an orderly manner, the alternative for Great Britain will be inability to buy goods from us which would mean that she would have to confine her trade to the sterling area.

“It's hard to realize speeds of 2,000 revolutions per second in a motor,” D. H.

Typical Small U. S. City Served by 5 Councilmen
The typical small city of less than 5.000 population has five councilmen, who arc paid $100 a year and are elected at large for three-year overlapping terms; the city owns and operates its water supply system, has 14 full-time paid officials and employees and spends $73,000 a year for the operation end maintenance of municipal services and for meeting debt charges.
Total expenditures of the average city were lower in 1943 than in the preceding year, and receipts from property taxes were larger. The typical city, according to the survey, has a long-term net debt of $98,000 which is 6 per cent less than the debt at the end of the preceding fiscal year. Earnings of city-owned utilities were larger in 1943 than in 1942, but revenues from licenses declined.
Thirty-seven cities, or 30 per cent of the total reporting, have 10 or less employees; 29 cities have from 11 to 15 employees; 30 cities have from 16 to 25 employees and 24 cities have more than 25 full-time employees—excluding school employes. Sixteen cities with annual expenditures in excess of $150,000 a year have an average of 40 employees which is more than double the average for all cities of 5,000 or less.

Proper Handling Assures < Good Homemade Milk
Milk of good flavor and quality from the family cow may be produced in the home, if it is properly handled, say extension dairymen.
First, they suggest that the milk be kept in standard glass milk bottles in the refrigerator or in a bucket or tub of cool water, where refrigeration is not available.
Just after milking, they suggest that the producer pour the milk through three or four folds of a good grade of cheese cloth. A small tin funnel can then be used for getting the milk into the bottles. It should then be capped with standard bottle caps.
For cooling the milk, the bottles can now be placed in a tub of cold water, for it cools more rapidly in this way than if put directly into the refrigerator. Where no refrigeration is available, they advise	it.

daily is the suggestion on the Basic Seven, the wartime nutrition guide. This vitamin is not stored in the body, and its daily inclusion makes healthy gums and teeth and helps one to avoid that tired feeling. When eaten in large amounts, raw or carefully cooked, a wide variety of fruits and vegetables are reported to be fair sources of vitamin C. Best substitutes for citrus fruits are tomatoes, raw carrots, cabbage, and green vegetables. Even the potato can be included in the list if it is baked or boiled with the jacket on.
Life on Atoll Lived
To Thunder of Waves
Lnact Laws to Govern
Increasing Bicycle Traffic
Appearance of a growing number of bicycles on the nation's streets and highways since 1940, coincident with restricted motor vehicle transportation, has led many cities to enact ordinances and take other steps during this period to regulate use of these vehicles.
At present, three of every five cities in the country report an ordinance in effect for the regulation of bicycles according to information to the American Municipal association.
Life on a Pacific atoll like the Marshalls or Gilberts is lived under the glare of the sun and the pallid light of moon and stars. Temperatures run high. Vegetation is likely to be sparse. Drinking water is a problem. Where coconuts grow thirst can be quenched with their milk*-Natives look to trees for much of their food—coconuts, pandanus fruit, breadfruit, bananas, and the like.

Fifty thousand loaves of bread— baked aboard ship would fill a nice
sized box car blessed with Scotch ancestors he’ll likely want porridge for breakfast. The Elizabeth’s answer to this is 90 thousand pounds of oatmeal for one trip.
The forty thousand pounds of sugar required for one sailing, if piled up n jute bags would be the size of a small haystack.
And it would take a flock of 300 hens laying the year round to supply the 90 thousand eggs required for the boys, for the trip home, with two for breakfast per man.
Seven hundred good sized steers would supply the meat. Enough tea and coffee are required for two million cups for the troops alone, not to mention the crew of 800 men who must be accounted for, besides.
Fifteen thousand pounds of dried beans, peas and split peas solve some of the vegetable problem, with an added 15 thousand tins of canned stuff.
The Scythia is a smaller ship but her pantry would make the average woman gasp with astonishment: five thousand pounds of cheese; 20 thousand pounds butter; two thousand cans of milk; 100 tons of .potatoes.
How would they ever get them peeled in time for dinner, we gasped? The ship’s stores man answered us. a little curtly, we thought, “They’re peeled by machine, of course”.

Disease-Resistant Seed
i The fungi and bacteria that cause some serious diseases of vegetable plants are often carried on the seeds. When the seeds are planted these organisms grow and injure the plant and may destroy the crop or reduce the yield. Gardeners have several simple and effective methods cf fighting these seed-borne diseases of garden crops.
Certified, or selected seed, because it has been inspected for any evidence of disease, is usually less likely to carry disease than uncertified seed.
Gardeners can also buy seed which has been treated to kill the seed-borne diseases. Cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, kale, turnip, kohlrabi, broccoli, tomato, and celery seeds are treated with hot water squash, muskmelon, pumpkin and watermelon are treated with corrosive sublimate.
To control damping-off, a disease which often kills the seedling plants soon after they sprout, a dust can be mixed with the seeds before they arc planted. Some seed firms treat the seeds before they ship them to customers
Rust Prevention
It is estimated that the navy is saving $10,000.000 annually through its rust prevention program. Corrosion of vital spare machine parts for combat and construction equipment has been sharply reduced. It is pointed out that more important than the saving of money is the intangible value of preventing possible delay in operations caused when vital parts arrive at the theater of operations in unusable condition.

The top of a stump is ideal for counting rings but, in standing timber of moderate size, foresters use increment borer. This «is on instrument which removes a cylindrical cross-section of wood about the diameter of a lead pencil. The rings in this section may be counted.
