Choir Mask Enjoyed by Large Congregation
The Christmas music at the United Church on Sunday was of a high order. Under the leadership of Miss Kathleen Woodley, with Mrs. Edgar Hodgins at the organ, the choir of tbout 40 voices excelled itself.
The choir sang as an echo chorus "Away in a manger” followed by a candle lighting processional to the carol "While Shepherds Watched". Besides three chorus numbers, two very effective numbers were the trio, "Harps of Gold ' with Mrs. A. D. Mc-C redie. Mi wee Barbara and Kay Woodley, and the two choir numbers "The Christmas Song”
At the morning service Mr. Glen Hodgins sang "The Hallelujah Song”. At the beginning of the two services Mrs. Edgar Hodgins played "Silent Night” by Kohlmqn. and Christmas Fantasia by Dunstan, and the pastor brought the messages appropriate to the day.

Canada will take whatever steps arc required to enable bacon exports in 1945 to reach the figure of not less than 600 million pounds. We shall need these supplies from Canada if our small ration of 4 ounces per week is to maintained throughout the year.

Wives Cannot Divorce
Soldiers Without Consent
A Prosperous and a Brighter New Year
One thing the hasty war bride must forego for the duration is a divorce from the husband she may have chosen too quickly from the armed services. She can be divorced only if her husband agrees to the proceedings, legal authorities

J. L H0DG1NS and STAFF
say.
The reason is that a federal law prohibits judgment by default against any person in uniform and this applies to divorce as well as other legal proceedings. No matter how strong the grounds for divorce may be, the wife is helpless unless the husband voluntarily signs a waiver of his rights. He may be across the street from the courthouse. but cannot be compelled to come in and answer a divorce complaint. Until six months aftei the war. he is immune unless he wills otherwise.
He will of course be obliged to support his wife; but if she has, after marriage, discovered things about him which she did not previously know, and which make her feel that a divorce is imperative, she will have to spend the rest of the war as his wife unless she can gain his co-operation.

New Plastic Window Aids U. S. Deep Sea Divers
Seventy of the government's deep sea divers, including 25 working on the gutted S. S. Lafayette (Normandie) in New York harbor, are wearing a new type helmet with a window of crystal-clear plastic.
A light, virtually unbreakable window of “Lucite” methyl methacrylate resin eliminates the heavy metal protective grille needed in old type helmets. It increases the diver’s field of vision, reduces the weight of the headgear, and makes it easier for the diver to maneuver.
These helmets have been used at depths down to 320 feet in various parts of the world, and much greater depths are predicted by the manufacturer. A helmet made entirely of “Lucite” is being tested.
The streamlined helmet’s curved window is made from the same plastic which is now used in record quantities for the noses, gun turrets, navigation “blisters” and other transparent enclosures on military airplanes.

More Than 10,000 Dogs
Served in World War I
Dogs were widely used as messengers in World War I between Iront ! r.es and headquarters. They s''’doin' failed to deliver messages unless killed on the way. They were trained to work in the noise and confusion of battle. These dogs could carry messages three times as fast as men. dashing over shell holes, leaping trenches, swjmming streams and wriggling through barbed wire.
Dogs were used also to carry homing pigeons intended to fly messages for longer distances. The pigeons were placed in baskets strapped to the dog’s back. Hot soup for fighting men at the front reached many soldiers by “dog back.”
Dugs proved great aids to sentries at night, when their keener sight end hearing enabled them to reveal to the sentinel the approach of the enemy. These dogs were trained not to bark, but to disclose hostile approaches without making any noise.
At the time of the signing of the Armistice, it was estimated that about 10,000 dogs, of all breeds and mixtures, were used at the front.

Soybeans Nutritious
Green edible soybeans can be a valuable addition to the diet, especially in these days of meat short-
ages.
Soybeans are far richer in protein and fat than other legumes and are good sources of calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamin and riboflavin. All of the eight varieties tested contained approximately the same amount of vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, as the green peas tested and slightly more than the freshly harvested snap beans.
Green soybeans are ready to be prepared for eating as soon as the pods are well filled and while they are still green in color. They have a better flavor if prepared promptly after picking, since their sugar content decreases rapidly if held at room temperature for any length of time. In order to make hulling easier, pour boiling water over the tough, fibrous pods and let them stand for five minutes. Then drain and hull the soybeans by breaking the pods crosswise and. squeezing out the beans.	mt—

Men are still urgently needed to cut pu Ip wood—there’s a job waiting jor you now. Here’s an opportunity to increase your income this winter by working in the bush. The camps are good—the food is good—and transportation is arranged. Plan to make some extra cash for yourself—cut pulpwood this winter and return to the farm next spring.

f	.. -	*
MILITARY POSTPONEMENT NOT AFFECTED
M ;
As in 1943, pulpwood cutting is again classified as an essential war industry. This means you can cut pulpwood and keep your status as farmer if you already have postponement—and provided your, absence will not affect winter production on the farm."

Shipbuilding Differs
Conditions between World War I shipbuilding and building now are in but few respects similar. The clue to our current successes, beyond plain, enormous effort in producing and transporting and assem- ing bling materials, is préfabrication.
Préfabrication was applied during the First World war. In the present instance it has been expanded by techniques worked out by the engineers and rushed into production.
For example, welding has, as compared with First World war snipbuilding practice, largely replaced riveting. For the purpose, welding is faster and it reportedly produces joining that is less vulnerable to tor-f ido shock.

ACT NOW
Salt is the agent primarily responsible for curing. Excessive amounts of salt injure the flavor of the meat and cause a too great hardening of muscles. Too small an amount allows bacterial action to set in, causing subsequent spoilage of the meat.
Sugar is used in the curing process to counteract the hardening effect of the salt and to improve the flavor and texture of the meat. White or brown sugar, or even molasses, may be ussd.

For Winter Evenings
It' $ important to make sure the lighting of the home meets winter needs.
Each member of the family should have a good light for study, read ing, sewing, or other close work When your eyes have to work to make out each word, soon your whole body feels the strain.
Portable lamps with 100 to 150 watt bulbs should be used fur eye-tiring jobs. Don’t skimp by using smaller bulbs than you actually need. Next, arrange the furniture and the lights so you can sit within three feet of the light source when you do close work. In general, the light should shine over the left shoul dcr of a right-handed person or the right shoulder of a left-handed per

It’.- important also to avoid glare by using deep shades with broad bases which allow the light to spread over a wide area Small shades with straight sides arc ‘light hoarders” so they should be replaced with larger, more open types.
Keeping the lamps clean makes a big improvement in lighting. Thi? means dusting not only bulbs - but ’Shades and diffusion bowls which may absorb as much as 20 per cent of the light. Finally, make sure the shade lining is light so it will reflect a maximum amount. Much the same directions apply to other types of lighting besides electricity.

Gross State Debts Take
Big Dip in Three Years
Gross state debts have declined increasingly the last three years; the total is now $2,909,150.000 as compared with $3,526,407,000 in 1940. This decrease, according to the Council of State Governments, is exclusive of surpluses which are being earmarked either for special postwar projects or programs for the rehabilitation of servicemen and their families, highway construction and capital improvements of hospitals and educational institutions.
If all surpluses were used to retire state debts—in many states such funds cannot be used for this purpose, in others state officials do not want to use the funds in this way— the actual amount of gross debts would be much less, as surpluses 'alone are in excess of $1,000,000,000.
Generally decreases in individual state debts are due to greatly increased revenues and reduced expenditures as well as to the lack of construction work resulting in a minimum issuance and a greater redemption of bonds

They were both young, one big, about his own build, the other small and fat with red checks, and they were both fashionably and expensively dressed; they had the air of idle wealth. They were evidently disputing something between themselves, and Mark got the impression that he was their ch'et interest. It nettled him; he hurried his food down, drank his tea and paid his bill. It left him twenty cents. As he counted his change and thrust it back into his pocket he laughed bitterly to him-i. *f. IIow would Fosdick like *o face his night in the city, with twenty cents? He was just rising from the table when his two young neighbors suddenly rose, over, and pulling out the two empty chairs opposite, sat duwn, uninvited, at his table.
The stout young nan leaned forward confidentially, his red cheeks growing redder.
“Pardon me,” he said courteously, smiling across at Mark; “It's a wager

Message of Joy
In the Christmas story is revealed the tact that Gods ways are not man's ways., For centuries the promise of a Messiah and a deliverer for Israel was repeated. Not to the Roman governor, or the Chief Priest in the temple did God's messengers come, but to humble God-fearing shepherds who had been eagerly awaiting the coming of their Saviour.
They were in the country, in the silence of the night, watching over their flocks. The angel of the Lord

That glimpse may intensely their longing for the folks hack home, yet they will like to remember that over there will he the same Christmas dinner — Mom will manage somehow, sugar or no sugar and there will be folks coming . . . and the same excitement over gaily wrapped parcels. Gee, it sure would be great to be there . . .maybe next year . . .

The Jade God
Of all the seasons of the year Christmas is the "most loved, and probably the most significant, because
there certainly would have been no Easter, nor Asccntion. Most loved because it is a season so readily understood and appreciated by us, the common typifies the love, the and the close union of humble family life. And so, home-loving people throughout the ages have tiled to create an ideal of goodwill and fellowship in their own family circles. How well they succeeded is reflected in the attitude which each succeeding generation has toward Christmas at home.

smiled amusedly.
“Come around tomorrow morning and I'll have the papers ready. The money’s in deposit at the bank
here, waiting.”
“Shut up?”* Archie broke in suddenly, “you’re only babbling, Ted. Let’s get to busness.” He turned a little haughtily and faced Mark. “It's this way. My pal here has been getting into trouble with a ladv, an elderly and exclusive lady, one of the smartest of the smart set; she won’t have a man in her house who drinks too much, or gambles, or—” he shrugged — “you know the usual things! Teddy was a prime favorite, but she caught him gambling, and then he • got stewed, two of the cardinal sins. She’s forbidden him the house, and he’s sore. There’s going to be an exclusive afternoon today, a big affair. Ted has no card. He’s raw about it, and he’s laid a wager with me that she’s all bunk about her rules, that she doesn’t really know what her guests do, that any fellow — the first man we met in I the street — given a clean shirt could pass muster. I’ve taken the bet. I don’t believe she’ll receive anyone without credentials, she’ll find a way to freeze the newcomer out, even if a fellow took him in, unless she knows he’s all right. Ted's bet me a thousand dollars that he can pick up the first man he meets outside the club, give him the clothes and get him in — if I’ll take him past the door and simply say: ‘This is Mr. — oh,
any old name! Now, do you see?”
* * *
Mark nodded: “I see!” he said, and laughed. There was vigor in his laughter, a jubilant ring of freedom.
“I met you first outside the club,” he said, “that's the whole of it. It’s a wager—” he made a boyish grimace — “I don't want to lose my thousand dollars, Archie, here, is a bit stiff-necked about it. You — I wonder—” he leaned back, thrusting his hands into his pockets and jingling his money rather obviously — “1 wonder if you'll help me out? It's only for one afternoon, you know, at a tea, there’ll be dancing no end of fun, but the test will be the dinner afterwards. She only asks the elect to that — the uns oî Colonial dames, 1 call ’em. 1 bet she’ll ask you.”
“What do I get?” asked Mark.

Unfortunately there are also homes where only memories of fighting sons remain. It is not for me to say how Christmas shall be observed in such homes only hope that to them will come some measure of healing and comfort during the season of peace and goodwill.
But to thd thousands of other homes let me send along this message with my kindest regards and good wishes . . . Keep Christmas —whatever you do keep Christmas. Put your heart into it and the way will be clear, for where there is Christmas in the heart there will surely be Christmas in the home.
Good-bye and “God Bless us everyone".

Mark rose, but stopped with his hand on the back of his chair. “It's early yet, Mr. Fosdick, and I’d be glad to draw some of that money. I’m short.”
.The little lawyer whipped around in his chair and stared at him, then away. “The fellow’s a giant!" he thought uneasily, remembering old Grant Barton’s end. Money in that, too!
“I can’t help it," he said testily, “there'll be formalities. Come tomorrow. The bank closes at three;
couldn’t get through in time. I’m busy; good day!”
Mark stood a moment longer, looking down at him. He saw the little man’s hand shake as he grasped his pen and pretended to write. Mark knew he was afraid of the ex-convict; he threw back his head and laughed again, his laugh startling Fosdick as much as a blow; it was so hearty, carefree, a boy's laugh.
“You seem to find it amusing, sir,” he said tartly.
“I do!” Mark turned, picked up his hat, a new one, the warden had fitted him out. and went to the door. “Good-day, Mr. Fosdick,” he said,
still smiling, and went out.

Fosdick's gray face twisted into a grim smile. “1 don't think I 11 try not in your way. Let me see; how old were you when you went up?”
“Seventeen.”
“Seventeen? Gosh ” The lawyer stared at him for a moment, incredulously. “I'd forgotten. A boy — and convicted of killing that old man, your uncle — to get his money, too!” he added reproachfully.
Mark’s face sobered. His darkened. “Convicted?" ^ ou that travesty a fair trial."’
The old man recoiled but he steadied himself to face the -young fury in Mark’s glance. It was a fair trial; I always said so; you appealed, too, ” he maintained his point dryly; then he put Mark’s anger aside with a gesture. “I’ve time to take that up. I dare say you’ve suffered for it.
