Ottawa Exhibition to be Held Under Huge Tents
When Ottawa Exhibition opens tor a <ix day run on August 18th it promise* to be one of the must unusual big time exhibitions ever held in Canada. Never before has a class A fair attempted to stage its show under can vans. Very rightly it is being called the
Tented City Fair.”
Over 75 huge tents, many of them regular circus big tops, will
be required for the live stock, agricultural and various other exhabits, All Eastern Canada had to be combed over to get enough
canvass. In addition concessions, midway and commercial exhibits will require at least another m tents, enough in all to provide accomodation foi a small army.
This will be the unique feature of Ottawa Exhibition this year, something in itself well worth going to Ottawa to see I ho directors were forced to resort to tents as regular buildings at Cans-downe Falk are being tved tor military purposes thi* year.
While first an agricultural anti live stock show the 1941 Ottawa Exhibition will not lack in enter taiurnent features. One ot the finest grandstand shows ever brought to Eastern Canada has been secured and there will be a huge midway. A great number ot special events h is been arranged for including concerts by many outstanding boys' binds Horn Ottawa district towns. lhere will be both afternoon and even iiig grandstand performances.

Two London Boy Scouts, Patrol Leader Jack Olden and Patrol Second Dennis Edwards, were on fire watching duty in their district when one of the last heavy Nazi bombing raids occurred. At 2 o’clock in the morning they were in the thick of the fight to quench incendiary bombs.
At 3 a.m. a new and heavier wave of bombs, high explosives and incendiaries, fell further down the street. One incendiary had gone through to the basement of a dentist’s premises and lodged in a cupboard. When the two Scouts arrived the fire was blazing furiously, but they attacked it with their stirrup pumps and sand, and eventually succeeded in putting it out.
Then they made their way to a burning school, where they took over the hose and tackled the fire while the firemen attacked the blaze in a hall next door.
Next, seeing a blaze on the roof of a five-storey building, they climbed in through a window and made their way to the top. No hand-pumps were available there, but they found some buckets.

Contending for the Faith
Jude 3: 3. “Beloved, while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.” If, then, we have in our hands not only an inspired Word from God, but the only inspired Word that God has given to men, permanently recorded in writing, how tragic if this Word should be lost, if its glory should be minimized, if its truths should be perverted, or twisted, or denied.
Peter’s Testimony Peter 3:14. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight. 16. And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you; 16. As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction.”
The apostle has just been speaking of the coming of the Lord, and especially of those who, in a scoffing way, insisted that the Lord was not coming because thus far they had not seen Him. But, says Peter, the day of the Lord will come. If such is so, and righteousness is to reign at his coming, and we are to be in a new world by His grace, then we ought to give diligence to our personal life. These things, said the Apostle Peter, Paul himself, their beloved brother had unfolded in some of his epistles, which, he admitted, were quite hard to
The designation
too.
Paul’s Gospel Inspired
Gal. 1:11. “For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. 12. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I tatight it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.” The Apostle Paul is here defending the supremacy of his message over all false teaching, which had been brought into the Galatian Churches by Judaizers and by those who were mixing works with the truth of salvation by grace. Verse eleven might be said to present the negative side of the question—his Gospel did not come from men; the twelfth verse presents the positive aid it came to him through revelation of Jesus Christ.
How Thessalonians Received It
I Thess. 2:13. “And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, ye accepted It not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.” Paul had himself preached to the Thessalonian Church, a record of which is found In Acts 17:1-0. The First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first epistle, as far as we know, that Paul ever wrote as an apostle to one of the great Christian Churches of his day. He is commending the Thes-ealonians for receiving his message not as one based on human speculation, on man’s wisdom, but as one given to him by God, though spoken through mortal lips. Paul was but the instrument, God was the primary author and origin.
The experience of the Apostle Paul with the Thessalonians ought to be, even if in a lesser degree, the experience of ’ all true ministers of the Word of God, as they stand before their people to preach.

A letter from a reader of the Ottawa Journal gives proof of the importance of speed In consumption of gasoline by motor vehicles.
This reader drove a new car to Montreal and back, keeping rigidly within a 35-mile speed limit, and had an average run of 25 miles per gallon. A fortnight later he made tho same trip "in a hurry," and the mileage per gallon was cut to 17 or by 32 percent. Put it another way/ he made the first round trip on about ten gallons of gasoline; the second time, because he was "in a hurry," the engine consumed about 14. gallons.
Every driver of experience knows he pays heavily for speed, not only in fuel hut in wear and tear on him car, especially if he gets into the upper reaches beyond the legal limit of 50 m.p.h. For most cars, it is said, the economical speed is 35 to 40, and that is fast enough, usually, to get the driver to his destination as quickly as he needs to reach it. And just now there is the added point, that the use of gasoline in this country must be reduced, by compulsion if not voluntarily, and the general adoption of a moderate speed In country driving might save the necessity for more drastic measures, or at least defer them.

His Doctrine of Inspiration
It is interesting to note that In Paul’s last three epistles, the two to Timothy, and the one to Titus, he speaks more often of faith, of teaching, of doctrine, of the truth, of the Word, of Scripture, than in any other part of any of his writings of similar length. It is quite significant that the greatest statement Paul ever made about the Word of God, he makes here at the end of his life, a conclusion resulting from long years of absolute devotion to Christ, and the Word of God.

Towards Complete Lives
2 Tim. 3:14. “But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. 15, and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16. Every scripture inspired of God it also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for Instruction which is in righteousness.” Of course this passage refers primarily to the Old Testament Scriptures.
Testament is inspired, how much more so the New, which records the very words and acta of the Saviour Himself, and was written \ty those who companied with the Lord, or were in fellowship with those who did.. “17. That the man of God may be complete, furnished complete unto every good work.” Verse sixteen tells us that the Word of God #k inspired, and what it can do for us, but verse seventeen tells us that all t*i<*e things are to the end that we, belonging to God, may be complete in our lives end equipped for every good work.

Mrs. H. M. Aitken, director of women’s activities at the C.N.E disclosed ^recently that a letter had been sent by the C.N.E. women’s department to the headquarters of the Women’s Voluntary Services in each of the bombed cities and towns of Great Britain, telling of the plan whereby 1.700 women from thirty Canadian women’s organizations will work in the six big work rooms of the Women’s Building during the 1041 Exhibition preparing clothes for bomb victims in the Motherland. Each city was asked to reply making known its individual requirements.
Each of these "blitzed” towns and cities, including Plymouth, Birmingham, Manchester, London, Glasgow, Dover,
Sheffield, Belfast, Bristol, Newcastle, Ramsgate, Portsmouth, Swansea, Liverpool, and Southampton, made prompt reply to the C.N.E. query, in each case expressing their great appreciation. From Dover, Plymouth, Liverpool
Mrs. A. M. Beeston, Centre Organizer of the W.V.S. in Dover, for example, writes: "It is kind of you to suggest sending clothes to us here in Dover. We shall be delighted to have anything you send, and we are. indeed, most grateful to you all. Please thank all the organizations who are working for us, and tell them the spirit of Dover is grand.”
Another Centre Organizer, Mrs. T. B. Davie, of Liverpool, gays: "I am quite sure that you have no idea of the deep impression the generosity and sympathy of the Dominions make on the people here.”
"Thank you very much for your kind letter,” writes Mrs. Madge Wordley, on behalf of Plymouth. "Plymouth has had a bad time, but the courage of the people is wonderful and their hearts are high. Through the Women’s Voluntary Services, approximately 6,500 people have been clothed here during the last three months, and thanks to the wonderful gifts being received from the Dominions and America, we hope to continue this help for those who have suffered such terrible losses. May the day soon come when the war with all its distress and misery is over, and victory is assured for the Empire, so that we may all go forward together in creating a better and a happier world for the future generations.”

In an effort to assist in raising funds for the Jasper-Banff Spitfire Fund, six famous ailists have
donated original paintings which are now on display in the rotunda of Jasper Park Lodge and are attracting much attention. The artists who have given their paintings to assist this fund are Roland Gissing, Grandmaison,
Whyte, Carl Rungus, Belmoro Brown and Roland Jackson.
All artists are well known in the world’s art circles and have done a great deal of work in the Canadian Rockies. They specialize in scenic subjects, with the exception of Roland Jackson, who features wild life and Grandmaison, whose ambition is to perpetuate the life of the rapidly vanishing North American Indian. He is looked upon as an outstanding authority on the interpretation of Indian lore and character.

The town of Plessisville, P.Q., on the Canadian National Railways between Victoriaville and Levis, plays an important part in the flax producing industry of the province of Quebec. In Plessisville are manufactured many of the specialized machines required for the harvesting and the treatment of flax so that it may be transformed into linen. War greatly upset sources of supply of flax fibre and stirred Canadian enterprise to a speed-up in production and manufacture. It is estimated that approximately 28,000 acres of Quebec land have been given over to flax growing this year and mills are ready to handle the crop. Since the days of the early settlement flax has been grown on many Quebec farms and spun on the wheel during the winter months. Now the spinning has reached the export stage and a training school in Plessisville is graduating machinists, spinners and weavers.

When a Chinese cook leaves his place of employment, he imparts the character of his employer in
a novel way, an American returned from the Orient states. Rice at the bottom of a pan says that the head of the house is stingy. The lid lying on the floor beside the pot means a hard place and frequent shortage of servants.
The saucepan placed upside down denotes a hot-tempered master, but if laid on one side it means the whole family is hard to please. If the pot is left on the stove inverted, wages will come regularly. If the bottom of the pot is chalked, it signifies that breakage is taken out of wages.

Garbage Feeding an Industry
An agriculture venture of which little is known has gradually grown into being in this country in the past few years. - This is the garbage feeding of hogs. This industry flourishes in the more populous cities and near the larger cities. Reports show that For bins there are about 1,500,000 garbage-
fed hogs being marketed yearly in this country. About half of this number are fed annually and exclusively on garbage, while the other half arc finished with more or less grain. While garbage-fed hogs are used.

Canadians Asked to Eat Less Pork
t
% •
The Bacon Board, in a statement to the people of Canada to eat less pork of all kinds, including bacon and ham, during the next three months in order that British needs for more Canadian bacon can be met.
The statement is as follows It will be necessary for the people of Canada, during the next three months, to substitute lamb, beef, veal, poultry, vegetables and fruits for pork products if the request of the British Min istry of Food for more Canadian Bacon is to be met.
At the present time Canadians are consuming the equivalent in poik products of about 44.000 hogs per week. In March and April of this year the con sumption was up as high as 54,000 hogs week. The decrease of about 10,000 hogs per week was the result of the action of the Bacon Board restricting the supply of pork products to the domestic trade to the average weekly consumption of 1940. efleet of increasing the simply for export to Britain, but the requirements which the British Ministry desires are not being met, consequently the people of Canada are asked to co operate and eat less pork products.
It is expected that by next Fall the marketing of hogs in Canada will be rufficient in volume to meet British ex port requirements and leave plenty for home consumption in Canada.
It is felt that this appeal to the people of Canada at this time of the year to eat less pork of all kinds, will not entail any hardship as there are abundant supplies of • other good foods available which will provide suitable summer men ns.

Now Use Weed Spraying Machines
Twenty counties in Ontario and a large number of townships have pur. chawed or rented power sprayers fur the eradication of weeds by chemicals, because they have found that weeds can be killed by this means at less cost than mowing. A number of county engineers and township road otticia’s have report-1 ed that costs have become less each . year and that in a short time touching up of scattered plants will be all that is 1 required to keep roadsides clean of weeds1

In Ontario’s History
In our land there are few places where the soil or the rock is normally exposed to the air. Nearly everywhere under natural conditions a heavy growth of plant life and protects the soil. This protection cuts erosion to a minimum so that very little soil disappears into the rivers during the year. At one time every stream in Ontario flowed clear and cool the year around. Erosion haidly existed because of the cover of
plants and trees.
The first settlers needed agricultural lands so they cut the trees from many parts of the

Its easier on the hostess to have a guest state her preferences about food than to say, "I like everything" and then not eat much of anything on the table. Saying "1 don't play bridge" is easier on everybody, especially the hostess, than playing so badly that half th* other guests are annoyed.
Shipping Losses Decrease
That Britain’s position had vastly improved from a year ago was the opinion of Kirke L. Simpson. Associated Press military correspon-i dent, who stressed, among other factors in the situation,, the sharp decrease in British shipping losses. He said: "London’s ship-loss figures for June tell the story. They were the lowest since July, 1940 (329,296 tons), except for a period in the dead of last winter. Indications are that the present month’s losses will fall even lower, due to Nazi air concentrations in the east, to probable withdrawal of some German submarines for use against Russia in the Baltic and to British counter measures at sea.” The Battle of the Atlantic would appear to be veering in favor of Britain and the United
States.
Collapse of Vichy Resistance
The British lifelines had also been greatly strengthened in the Middle East by the Syrian victory, and the political results, it was predicted, would be of much more consequence.
There could be no doubt that the outbreak of the Nazi-Soviet had much to do with the collapse of Vichy resistance to the British-Free French allies in Syria and Lebanon. It ended the last hope oi the "men of Vichy” for effective German intervention there, render followed Inevitably.

Test all jars before using. Adjust rubber rings, fill with water and invert to test for leaks. Discard any jar which cannot be made air-tight, ecoffomy.
Always use fresh rubber rings. Always sterilize jars thoroughly, and if possible, give them a sundrying and I guarantee there will be no spoiled fruit.

FISH INDUSTRY WILL BENEFIT
With the bacon board asking consumers to cut down their consumption of bacon and ham and other pork products and prices of other meats fairly high, department officials regard this as an opportune time to get Canadians into the way of eating fish.
"1 am sure the fish industry will be fully alive to this opportunity," said Dr. D. B. Finn, deputy minister of fisheries. "While bacon and fish taste different both are rich in protein and from a nutritive standpoint are similar,” he said.
