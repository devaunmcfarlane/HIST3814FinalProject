But the intrepid Mehodist saddle-bag preachers of those days from the Bonnechere circuit on the South •shore, valuing highly the souls of these settlers, visited their settlements and homes, and by 1830 a class of 40 had been organized in Clarendon Centre.

Howard, Stephen Brownell and John Armstrong.
Since that time there has been an unbroken chain of preachers serving the very important Clarendon, (later Shawville,) circuit they have given were of the highest order, and the Church has prospered under their ministrations. Of those who served the congregations only four are still living: Rev. Fred Tripp, who was here from 1915 to 1919, and is now retired in Montreal; Rev.
Mahlon I. Robinson, who was here from 1919 to 1924 and is now in Cannington, Ont., United church;
Rev. M. E. Wright, who was here from 1928 to 1931, and is now minister of Chesterville, Ont., United church, and the present Pastor Rev.
Alex. F. Fokes, who has been here since 1931.
To celebrate this 110th anniversary special services arc being held on Sunday morning, June 3rd, with Rev.
Chas. Dawes, minister of Aylmer United Church as preacher. In the evening, the Pastor will give an address on the early days of the Church in Shawville, and for both services, the choir are preparing special music appropriate for the occasion.
On Monday a congregational get-together will be enjoyed, with interesting historical and other features, and an evening of music by Rev.

Ash Bricks
Grateful leader Gen. H. D. G. Crear, G. O. C. First Canadian Army, thanks men of his Headquarters staff for their loyalty during the tremendans days between D-Day and V-E Day.
British scientists have produced a new fire-proof building material from waste ash which may save millions of dollars annually.
It is claimed that its strength improves with age; it is not influenced by frost or damp, it is vermin-proof; it can be plastered, papered and sawn screws and nails.
The new material is, made from waste product of electricity power-stations the ash residue from lur-which burn pulverized coal.
It is claimed that over 800 mil-lioin bricks could be produced in Britain with the ash, which is now thrown away, at an approximate cost of $0,645,000 a year.
The ash bricks have already been used in the construction of offices and workshops and one new housing estate estate in Central England is to have the first house built entirely of them.

One of the most pressing needs of the liberated peoples of Europe is farm machinery. Canada has undertaken to supply with 22,500 tons. • This, plus our exports to our old markets, will take 30 per cent, of all we produce.

power policy is one thing in Quebec
and another in the rest of Canada.
“My views today are the same as they were long before I became leader of this party in December, 1942", said Mr. Bracken in a speech at a political rally there, another stop-off point in his Dominion election campaign tour.
“When Mr. King used the device of the plebiscite to evade the issue of conscription, I described his manoeuvre as a crowning indignity. 1 was then Premier of Manitoba. As you will also remember, while 1 was still the head of the Manitoba Government, the Legislature of that province unanimously passed a solution in favor of conscription."
“Mr. King now says that this party is endorsing and lending its support to certain independent candidates in Quebec who are opposed to conscription. ... As leader of this party I have not endorsed nor do I propose to endorse any candidate who does not adhere to the principles and policy of the Progressive Conservative party”.

Here are some of the definite, practical steps taken by the Liberal Government to give rity to home and family by assuring well-paid post-war jobs for everyone:
Fer Veterans — llie most generous plan of any United Nation to get returned men started in the type of work each of them chooses. The Liberal Government is determined that every man and woman coming home to Canada shall return to the land of greatest opportunity in the world.
Fer Workers — About a third of all Canadians depend on exports for their livelihood. Liberal plans provide for increasing our exports 60% in value over those of 1939.
For Farmers — Acting on the belief that all Canadians prosper w hen farmers do, the Liberal Government has arranged that they con improve their farms and equipment under loan plan and has arranged to put a floor under the prices of farm and fishery products.
To stimulate employment for oil, the Liberal Government has created a special Department of Reconstruction which is now in operation and w hich will co-ordinate private and public enterprise.

‘What
fully kept is Shawville cemetery.
The people here must be of a high standard, when they take such pains to honour and show respect to their dead/*
There are no doubt, many who think just as this group did. They feel that it speaks well for a community when its “God’s Acre” looks neat and well cared for. But those who look back a few years will remember when the burying ground Phone 70 was, in appearance, a disgrace to the community. It was a wilderness of briars, brush and weeds. About ten years ago a group of public spirited citizens, delegated from the town Council, the Churches and the Women’s Institute formed a Renovation Committee, which has set itself the task of keeping in fit condition cur principal cemeteries.
Through the support of interested
people, 4'heir efforts have Keen a
real success, as a visit to the grounds will prove to all.
To do this work the Renovation Committee makes an appeal again for funds. It keeps a man at work on the lawns from May 1st to October 15th. It supplies him with tools and machinery to work with. The cost for this year is higher than last year, because of a rise in wages for our worker. It will cost the Renovation Committee about $400. this year to do the work they have been doing for he past ten years.

Even yet it doesn t seem possible that the war in Europe is Partner said this afternoon— “I suppose it won’t be long now before the boy is home again!” That, too, is hard to believe. We said good-bye to our son, determinedly resigning ourselves to a parting that might stretch into years. And now it may be a little less than a year before we see him again.

However there are other feathered friends that we find a little more cheery. To my great joy a pair of bluebirds are nesting the house. We haven't seen blue birds around here for years how I love them!

DEMOBILIZATION
Shawville, Que
In carrying out the demobilization of Canada's Armed Forces the primary consideration should be the interest of those who have served. Demobilization should be based on the principle that members of the Armed Forces should not be discharged until their economic security is assured by placement in gainful employment or by assisted training and education to that end.
Here, in this simple statement of progressive, realistic policy is the only true solution of the fundamental problem by which every ex-service man and woman is faced. It is the only assurance of a square deal for all veterans. It is the very basis of the Rehabilitation Policies of the Progressive Conservative Party. No veteran will be discharged against his will until he is assured of a decent livelihood.
"Platitudes will not fill empty stomachs,’’ declares John Bracken,
"nor generalities provide jobs for those who have fought, nor wordy declamations about sacrifice ease the load of the widows and children whose husbands and fathers gave life itself that ice might live in peace and security.”
Throughout the war, Canadian service men and women have had their fill of platitudes and generalities.
Let our veterans now ask themselves this question. Does the spirit of political partisanship which the King Government has consistently manifested in time of wqr, offer any assurance of a square deal for veterans in time of peaqe? Does the iniquitous manpower policy which split Canada apart reflect the right spirit ? Remember in war, as in peace, political policies infallibly indicate party principles.
It is significant that more than half of the Progressive Conservative candidates are service and ex-service men. No other party can even approach this record. These men know that no other party has such realistic and comprehensive plans for rehabilitation. They know that the Progressive Conservative Party is the service men’s party.
They know that John Bracken, father of three sons on active service, understands the problems, the hopes

and the fears of veterans.
They say, with John Bracken
"The cost of winning the war and the cost of re-establishing those who fought in it, is one and indivisible. In the plainest words at my command, I say to you that nothing short of fulltime gainfid employment for every man and woman who has worn the Canadian uniform will be acceptable. Every man and woman must be given an opportunity to earn a good living. If existing enterprise cannot do this, the State must, and will.’’
These service and ex-service candidates, with John Bracken, pledge themselves that, under no circumstances, will existing benefits to veterans be lessened. On the contrary, they will be increased and extended.
They, with John Bracken, pledge themselves to revise an out moded pensions act, to humanize its administration, to eliminate red tape and inexcusable delays. Pension rates will be reviewed at once and increased to bring them in line with higher living costs.
Under a Progressive Conservative government, recorded condition of personnel on enlistment will be accepted as sufficient proof in determining disability pension. The veteran will be entitled to the benefit of the doubt.
The “first in, first out" principle will be followed on demobilization — with a job at decent pey assured to the veteran when he returns to
“civvy" street. „

In the words of our leader, we of the Progressive Conservative Party,
"accept the challenge to detnonstrate to you who fought that you shall not be handicapped in days of peace because you responded to the nation’s call in days of war”
