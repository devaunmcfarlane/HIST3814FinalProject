When prospector Gilbert Labine, right, flew his «plane over Great Bear Lake in 1930 and found a rich pitchblende deposit only a tew miles from the Arctic Circle, little did he think his discovery would play an important part in production of the atomic bomb. The Canadian governmen took over the mine, location of which is shown on the map. The uranium derived from the pitchblende ore was used to make the bomb that helped to knock Japan out of the war. Only other known deposits are in Belgian Congo, South America and Australia. One of factors whi<h kept Oermany from perfecting its atomic bomb was that none of these sources of uranium was available to them.

Concentrating on one’s own work has been almost impossible these last few days. Mixed up with harvest and home activities are thoughts and fears—of the awful possibilities of atomic bombing. It grips one's imagination, sends shivers down the spine—and is so utterly fantastic as to be almost unbelievable. Comments from the press, pulpit and public have also been thought provoking—especially those which assert atomic bombing to be inhuman. There Is no doubt that such bombing is, of necessity, inhuman but one should also remember that It must be either they, or us, and if the use of atomic ho to-be serves to bring about the end of the war then surely their use is Justified.

Grandma was a pretty smart old lady. She didn't know that black currant juice was chuck full of vitamin <*, but she did khovv that when the children began to sniffle and sneeze a cup of hot black currant t%a would "fix them up, right smart."
It took the nutritionists quite a long time to discover that black currants are the very best source of this important vitamin, they know ft now division of nutrition at Ottawa has figures which show that currants arc one of the few fruits which are still an excellent source of vitamin C after being into jam
"The ptople who grow or can buy black currants should count themselves lucky," say the nutritionists. Their * figures show that two tablespoons of black currant jam will give about the amount of vitamin C as an orange at less cost.

What our men have been through under shell fire and as prisoners of war Is bound to have Its effect In the Immediate future. There will be times when they will be Irritable, restlees, and moody. I know bc&use I went through It after the last war. This Is a different war, and a different generation, hut fundamentally, cause and effect we the same. The men have done their part and, for those who return, whether they are able to adjust themselves to peacetime conditions, depends largely upon the women In their homes.

"No. no, I dreamed of him. He was alive again. He was smiling at me and holding out his hand to me and to Rosine. Tell me about the prisoners, Roger, please."
"Not now, my little one. Some other day, perhaps. Now It is time for all of you to have breakfast. Today if you like we shall go up into the mountain."
"That will be good. Roger," said Pol Martin gravely. "A lot of fun."
But Flight Lieutenant Roger Fabre was not to climb the mountain that day. Shortly after breakfast an R.C.A.F. station wagon, far faster and sleeker than bis own beloved jalopy, drew up In front of Philibert with orders for him to return to Montreal at once.
"1 felt It, somehow," he said ruefully to Merldel. "I have to go, but this time I take my happiness with me. When I return, dear, you will be ready?"
"I shall be waiting, mon brave," she said gravely. "I shall pray each hour for you—for your safe return."

Husband : “You don't stem to cas* for that sport jacket 1 dered for your birthday. Remember, 1 a viced if you preferred small or large checks."
Wife: “Ws. but how did 1 know you were talking about clothes?"



A total of 5,721 Allied owe their lives to the gallant crew* of Hie launches and planes of the British Air-Sea Rescue Service who picked them out of the water near Britain often under the noses of the Germans, the Air Ministry announced last week.
Overseas units of the service rescued at least 3,200 airmen and in area* other than the seas around («real Britain, 4,665 soldiers, sailors and civilians were saved.
At the tme of the Battle of Britain the Air-Sea Rescue Service was a small, improvised and improvising body, hut in time it developed into the highly specialized organization which sent out J36 R A F. craft, 60 United States coastal cutters and a large number of naval craft to play their part when the great D-Day fleet sailed for France.
One of its pilots touching down on the hk-nd of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean during a heavy air raid, was jusrt in time to receive the surrender of the Italian garrison in the invasion of 1943.

HUNGRY EUROPE NEEDS MEAT
X
MARRIED
It
The shortage of food in liberated Europe is desperate. Meat it one of the most critical needs.
As a great food-producing notion, Canada must, can—-and will—help to meet this emergency.
That is why slaughtering has been placed under strict control.
That is why ration coupons will soon be used again by Canadians to buy meat. There is only one objective.—To reduce meat consumption In Canada in order to provide direct aid for the hungry peoples of Europe.
