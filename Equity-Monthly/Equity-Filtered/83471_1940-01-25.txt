Scientists of Columbia University declare that all atoms, whether part of the heart tissue of man or a piece of steel, constantly emit radio waves which can be detected anil measured.
Even death of an animal organism does not mean the stopping of activity, they say, since the atoms •which form part of the living cell continue to emit radiation after the organism as a whole has censed to function.
BODY DOESN’T "BURN"' FUEL
The familiar old comparison of the body with a fuel-burning engine is being thrown out by modern medical science.
The chemical substances in the body — proteins, fats and carbohydrates — are constantly changing like a seething brew in a “witches’ cauldron,” it is said, whether
food is eaten or not.
Recent experiments have proved that food taken into the body merely enters into the great number of complicated reactions already going on.

Great Britain’s wartime architecture is shunning white houses. They are more easily seen from the air, especially in the country, than red-brick or dark walled buildings.
New homes will be sombre-colored and fitted with anti-gas, conditioning and raid shelters. Roof will be of concrete and steel to resist falling shrapnel. These plans are outlined by M. Robertson, of the Royal Institute of British Architects of London.
Wooden Shutters Back Again
“Old-fashioned wooden shutters will come back again,” he said. “They are useful both for blackouts and keeping out broken glass. Leaded diamond window panes will be fashionable.
They do not allow so much light through and a bursting bomb would only cause them to billow, not shatter. Gas or electric heater or central heating will displace coal.

The formal “afternoon call” upon neighbors has more or less died out; but any young bride is sure to come in for a certain amount of this kind of entertainment. So a few bints on the way to cope with the situation may be useful to the newly-weds.
Any time after three o'clock is afternoon “calling time.”
Have Tea Ready
Callers should stay only about a quarter of an hour, so anyone arriving before 3:30 p.m. will be safely away before tea-time. But should someone arrive nearer 4:00 p.m., or your conversation prove so entertaining that your earlier caller is still there when 4 p.m. approaches, you will have to say let me get you some tea.”
Who Makes First Move
Formal callers will leave cards at the end of a visit, either on the table beside them or uu the table In the hall. Then, when you return such visits, in about a week's time, leave cards similarly, and choose your time and length of stay to correspond with theirs. After these interchanges actually no further meetings need take place; but In any case, it is not for you to make the first move.

Advises Against Strenuous Sports
Violent Exertion Not For Girls — Strenuous Athletics Often Have Ill-Effects in Later Life
Outspoken opposition to the par-
girls in the more voiced by
ticipation by strenuous sports was Dr. 0. Shepherd, in his address to graduates of the (Ont.) Collegiate Institute, at the
school’s
WalkervHle.
commencement exercises
Strict Supervision
"To the student body, and especially the girls,” Dr. Shepherd, who is himself a graduate of Walker* ville Collegiate, declared, “1 would beg of them to refrain from, violent excursions in the realm of physical exercise, except under tho strictest of trained supervision.
“I should like to go on record here as being violently opposed to the participation of our girls in strenuous sports in leagues beyond the confines of this school. The tragic course of what I believe was one of our most famous girls’ teams speaks eloquently for itself.
Athletic Heart May Result
"It is a terrible and a shocking thing to have grown up with a group of girls, to have been proud of them and cheered them on, and then to have experienced the tragic end of nearly some third of that group, to realize now that those cheers woro hollow mockery and the urgings with which we forced them ou but sped them more quickly to an untimely end.
"Mark you. the so-called athletic
heart is one that already has been damaged before being subjected to severe physical strains and train-
ing.”

have been so successful all winter. The height of the new hats is not so great that it is worth special comment except that usually Paris milliners promote height for fall and not for spring.
One such hat is almost small enough to be called a toque in three round layers, the largest be-the lowest. One of the pret-fairly wide brimmed

Flowers or Fruit There are pretty flower trimmings at Suzy also, among smartest being small bunches of violets, one a little larger than the other, at opposite sides of the bnm of a small canotier of blacfl felt, each side rolled a little. Fruit is also being used by this milliner; tiny, smart and picturesque is a small shape in honey color felt or straw covered by velvet crab apples tinted by hand in rosy tones over the golden base.

Savings Plan to Help War Is Being Investigated
The Government, Finance Minister Ralston said Sa turd ly night, is going to institute a program whereby Canada’s small investors, at any time, cm put their savings into some sort of War Loan security of a suitable small denomination. •	~
Suggestions for such a program had been made, and the overwhelming re sponce of small investors to the recent
8200,000,000 War" Loan which was
heavily over-subscribed, showed the need of such a program.
“After the experience of last week 1 haven’t any doubt of the need and the usefulness of such an arrangement and I am announcing to you now that it has been decided to institute such gram.
Canadian» in a national broadcast for their response to the loan.
It may be along the lines of war saving certificates used in the last war but the details will take a little time to work out and whatever form the plan takes it will be announced just as early as possible.
What the plan will aim at is to encourage regular savings by giving the citizens of modesty means an « ity at any time—not just win Loan campaign is on—to invest tlmse savings in Dominion war savings securities of small denominations.”

GEORGE HY2TES & SOIT
Many sheep breeders in Canada are of the opinion that it is practically impossible to raise sheep profitably vn account of the large number of dugs which are allowed to run at large. This they consider.is serious in a country tint uses more wool per capita thin any other country and which in war time finds itself under the necessity of importing large quantities of wool t r wai contracts and for general use.
The Secretary of the Township of Clarendon reports that 91 sheep and lambs were killed in this municipality valued at 8437 30. One owner had I1' killed, another 17 and other* had as many as 13 killed
Raids on flocks of sheep by d«»g* co>t the townships of Renfrew county at least 82,230.80.
Unless something is done to lessen the danger from dogs it is certain less sheep will be raised. Such a condition might not be regarded as serious in normal peace time but with a war on, when wool is one of the mn.*t important agricultural commodities used exclusively for soldiers’clothing, it is very dangerous.
Sheep raisers throughout Canada are urging that legislation to deal with the menace be considered as a war time necessity by the Provincial Legist it lire*, ho that more sheep and wool in ty he

Water Helmets Devised
By Boys Prove Useful
What started as a boyish prank has turned into a profitable venture for a small group of Hammonds-port, N. Y., boys. In 1933, Charles nnd Bill Mummcrt, Joe Meade Jr., Norman Harrington and Harold Rapin were talking as they sat on the beach at Keuka lake after a swim. They all agreed that it was fun to dive deep and swim under water, but the common complaint that you couldn't remain under long enough.	,
“Wish we had a diving helmet," of them remarked. Another said, “Wonder if we couldn’t make one?”
A few days later the lads startled their parents when they appeared the beach with a diving helmet made from a glass demijohn, writes Emilie Hall in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. Under water went one, while the other remained the dock, pumping air to the diver through a relay of tire pumps.
It worked so well that they made two more and equipped two doubleaction diaphragm pumps for the air supply
from Mars, the helmets are cut so that they fit snugly against the shoulders, and padding, plus the air pressure inside, keeps the water out. Each helmet has a rectangular window through which the diver can

Prefabricated Kitchen
Has Many Advantage
An example of the advantages of | préfabrication as applied to the 1 building industry is the modern ; kitchen. Standardization and mass production of kitchen and bathroom 1 equipment are not only effecting : substantial economies in the cost of materials and their installation, but are speeding up new construction i and the modernization of old kitch-| ens.
Préfabrication of kitchen equipment received its impetus from the development of the cabinet type of sink. Subsequently matching floor and wall cabinets were developed to harmonize with the cabinets under the sink.
Today it is possible for the housewife to select the entire equipment for a new or modernized kitchen from standardized prefabricated units which include wall and base cabinets, cabinets under the enameled iron sink, and a kitchen range which is so constructed that it will ; tit perfectly into the stream-lined en-sembled effect created by the standardized units.
Despite the fact that these units are made in standard sizes, they are available in such a wide range : of models and colors that there is ample opportunity for the housewife to plan a kitchen which will reflect ! her own personal taste. There are ; three types of cabinets available for kitchens. These are wall cabinets, base cabinets and vertical 1 cabinets.
! Base cabinets are placed under ' the sink and under counters adjoining the sink or stove. All base cabinets are made the same heights as the sink and range, namely, 36 | inches. Studies by home economics experts carried on with the assistance of the plumbing industry have
•	revealed that this is the correct height for the average woman. It
•	is possible to vary the height if deI sired. Ample toe space is provided
at the base of the cabinets.

It all started in fun, but soon the boys found themselves in great demand, as summer cottagers, who had lost outboard motors, glasses, ! false teeth, jewelry and compacts in the deep lake waters, sought their help. They have made a tidy sum diving for these lost articles, charging half the value fur recovery. Some plumbing jobs have gone their way, too. When water pipes leading from the lake to cottages have become stopped, the boys have , donned their helmets and located the trouble.

Conestoga Wagon Named For City of Manufacture
The conestoga wagon or wain was so named because it was manufactured at Conestoga, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. This wagon had a high, boat-shaped body with curved canoe-shaped bottom, which fitted it especially for mountain travel.
The advantage of this feature was that freight remained firmly in place at whatever angle the body might till. The body was usually painted a blue or slate color and the sideboards vermillion could be lifted from its sockets. The wheels had broad tires, sometimes almost a foot broad. Six or eight bows wore arched over U:e body, the middle ones lower than those at the ends, and over these was spread stout white hempen cloth, strongly corded down at the sides and ends.

Donkey Was Responsible For Finding Silver Mines
Kellogg's Jack, a diminutive but thoroughbred jackass, was responsi- j ble for the discovery a few decades ago of two silver mines in the Coeur d'Alene mountains of northern Ida he that were worth $4,000,000.
The story is that the “jack,” i whose head was nearly as large as its body, was the pack animal for N. S. Kellogg, Phil O'Rourke and Con Sullivan when the trio went prospecting up a creek near the Mul-lan road, one of the first military routes through Idaho.
One night when the small party made camp they turned the animal loose to graze. In the morning it was not in sight, but the trail was found easily. Kellogg and his partners followed it.
Finally they emerged into a comparatively clear canyon and spotted the “jack" on a hillside. It seemed to be on a point like a dog. Ad vnneing they said they saw the an r .1 gazing intently at a broad splash of mineralized rock, which j proved to be a slab of rich galena

Away up on the edge of the Arctic Circle, Canada’s radium industry continues to make steady progress, according to reports received by the Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa. Production of radium from the property of Eldorado Gold Mines Limited on Great Bear Lake, N.W.T., has passed the 100-gram mark, and the output of uranium oxide and other associate minerals has yielded a further substantial return.
Pitchblende — 135 Tons Daily
Reserves of pitchblende ore have been increased, and the capacity of the mill at the mine has been stepped up to 135 tons daily, with recovery improved and costs lowered. The refinery at Port Hope, Ontario has a productive capacity of 108 grams of radium per year with facilities for processing from 8,000 to 10,000 tons of uranium compounds, and tor extracting radio-active lead and silver, also sulphide, and other materials. Although the mine and the refinery are more than three thousand miles apart, the output at the two points is carefully correlated, and au expansion program

Stylish Rigs, Then
When this rare “Chatham City Directory and County Gazetccr was published and compiled by James Soutar in that golden, preautomobile era, there were still more than a half-hundred men making a good living as, “hovse-ahoers and blacksmiths."
In the unmechanized town of that remote date, quite a nunibei of the men were still going to daily work as hostlers, or in h\-•ry stables where “comfortable and stylish rugs" were always at hand, and commercial travel was described as "a specialty."
Only “lamp-lighter” in Chatham was Frank Hargreaves, and Henry Marshall and Michael Dyer shared duties as the “bridge-tender." No editorial note was added to the dir. ectory to explain what a “tombstone traveller" was, but one cit-M#n was listed as filling that post;.
