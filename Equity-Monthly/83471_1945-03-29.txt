CHAPTER XIV
Tor the last twenty minutes, while the jade god was meeting its fate, I .andon's taxi had been speeding uptown. Tandon himself was no longer impatient; hr was glad of this ehancc to order his thoughts. It seemed certain that the bird had flown. In that case, was there any harm done? If Pam liked him she would have to forget him. It was plain to Tandon that Mark’s courage had filled.
"He didn’t want to face the unmasking,” he thought shrewdly; "be knew I'd have to do it.”
Yet he was uneasy; so uneasy that he had made up his mind to see Mrs. Lynn and feel his way, find out if she knew anything, and if Mark Grant had been there again. If hr suspected any effort to hold on to his acquaintance, he would denounce the convict rather than risk his making love to Pam Rodney. The thought made Tandon furious; he was still stinging from the tone of her refusal and was ripe for mischief when the taxi drew up at the house.

cried Mrs. Lynn; "Pam, téléphoné for the doctor— your uncle's ill!"
"I'm not ill,” Burleson said thickly, hut his hands went to his throat, he sank heavily into his chair, his eyes fastened on Mark. “You — away!” he exclaimed furiously.

It seemed to freeze his emotions, even his anger, his contempt for Tandon, grew cold. He put up his hand with a futile gesture, brushing back the hair on his forehead. He felt himself suddenly a convict, he might have been marching with his mates to the jail; the rest of it was a dream. Then he heard Tan-don's voice, shrill and womanish in its denunciation, and he longed to seize him—this puny product of society—and fling him out. He turned and looked at him with the contempt he felt, he was so big himself, he was so much of a pagan, as far as the world went, that it would have been nothing to pick the fellow up like a puppy by the neck. His hands clenched at his sides, his breast heaved; he had taken a step forward when Burleson’s voice arrested him “You'd better go,” the million-

were fastened on the shattered green hits on the floor and there was something akin to anguish in his face. * Burleson would never speak!
Mrs. Lynn, still in a panic, fled to the telephone. “We must have a doctor for you. Herbert," she cried, and came fare to fare with Tandon.
The voting man was standing at the threshold, one hand Mill on the portiere, his face livid. He did not understand the scene, hut he believed that Mark had come there to carry off Pam, that he was defying Burleson, and the girl loved him ! It w as the w ildest fancy, hut it kindled the spark.
“Why, Archie!” startled exclamation spell; she stopped with her hand on the telephone receiver and gazed at the young man in open amazement

At the door hr got his first shock; Mrs. Lynn was at home but she was not alone; they had company— "a gentleman." Tandon found out who it was without difficulty, and hi* blood boiled. He had intended to wait in the reception room, but, as he entered it. be heard the crash of the jade god in tne library and a startled cry from Pam.

Tandon did not notice her ex-I pression. He had made up his mind I to burn his bridges. He walked into I the room and stood in front of Mark.
“N ou ve no right to stay in this house.” he said in a choked voice; “the sooner you go the better—unless you want me to tell them the truth about you."
Mark looked at him and through him. My business here isn't with you. hut with Mr. Burleson,” he % answered crisply; "after that—perhaps!”
“Your business is with me,” Tandon panted, “for I brought you here. I—” he swung around, facing Mrs Lynn's frozen look, Burleson’s streaked face and Pam's indignant eyes. “I owe you all an apology ! T brought this fellow here by mistake ; I didn't know the truth. He's an ex-convict "

Mark met h is eyes ; he hated the man for his injustice. He knew that Burleson could have helped him. He remembered his testimony against him, and he had the jade god all the time! No one had thought of that.
Tandon, shaken by what he saw in Mrs. Lynn’s stiffening face, in Pam's bowed head, pursued his point.
“He was up for murder—fifteen years,” he said, “he's just out."
Mark turned on him then, and something in his look made the other man give way. Unconsciously Tandon stepped hack and Mark passed him, taking his stand near the door before he turned to face them.
“He’s told the truth; I'm an exconvict and I was accused of killing my uncle.” he said in a hard voice, “and this gentleman”—he indicated Tandon scornfully—“introduced me here on a wager. That's all—quite all!” He stopped an instant, his eyes sought Pam and caught the lovely arch of her prone head beside her uncle's chair. She did not look up and a dull despair seized him. Not even she would believe in him?
“It's true,” he said again in his . hard voice, and his eyes flamed upon Tandon, the wager-maker, the coward! “The convict bids you all good-bye."
Again he looked at the girl, but she had not moved. He caught the frozen horror in Mrs. Lynn's face, Burleson’s gray ness, Tandon s anger and malice.

Quebec Legislature Thursday, March C>2nd by E. C. Lawn. Liberal member lor Pontiac.
Mr. Lawn said the farmers want electricity, but must have it atreason-
«ble prices it had been said in Pontiac County that there would be electricity reductions, but after the elections the contracs submitted to the municipalities had been such that two of the municipalities had rejected them the grounds that the rates offered higher. If he farmers have to build transmission and other lines and then pay high prices for the power rural electrification would not .work out, said Mr. Lawn.
In his own municipality of Campbell's Bay it cost $10,500 a year for lighting, and the whole municipal budget was only $5,000. That indicated the cost was exorbitant. There

Campbell's Bay got its water supply from a company at cheaper rates than charged in Montreal and Quebec, and why should not the electricity be cheaper than it was. since the water cost nothing, end all that was neded was the machinery?
Mr. Lawn felt that if the electricity company which supplies his neighborhood were to reduce rates they would get more clients, and. in any event, he did not see why the company was not willing to accept a little skimmed milk with the cream.

PLANS FOR RETURN OF WORKERS TO FARM
EASTER DAY
St. Matthew’s Charteris
New Insurance Books for the fiscal year 1945-46 will be exchanged by the Local Employment and Selective Service Office in your area for expired Insurance Books upon completion of the second last page in the expired books.
Protect the benefit rights of your employee#*
by sending in their expired books properly completed on March 31st.
Plans have ben completed by National Selective Service for the return to the farm of the agricultural workers who were temporarily employed in other essential industries during the Winter months. As was ,the case last year, says Hon. Humphrey Mitchell, Minister of Labour, the dates at -which farm workers must be released by employers in other industries will be fixed by localities. Dates for the different localities will be fixed and announced by the Regional superintendants under the National Selective administration, after consultation with Provincial agricultural officers.
The men will return to the farm immediately their services are needed on the farm. The farm labor situation itself will be serious this year and it is necessary that the men should not be retained in other industries once their help is needed back home on the farm.
Farm workers leaving their winter work are required to give 7 days separation notice before returning home. Anyone in doubt—should get in touch with the nearest employment and selective service office. rWith regard to the forest industries in which a large proportion of the farmers are seasonally engaged, it has been agreed that last year’s arrangement worked satisfactorily I and that the proposed plan for 1945. following last year's procedure, should meet the needs of the case all round.

In the majority of cases the grain returned to farmers from these centres were 95 per cent free of noxious weed seeds 98.45 per cent of detrimental plant seeds are in this way eliminated from the sowing seed. For instance, before cleaning, each pound of grain contained an average quantity of 935 weed seeds, whereas after screening, only 15 could be found.
The foregoing figures are proof of the efficiency of cleaning seed grain before sowing • merely if only the fact of eliminating weed seed is taken into consideration.
