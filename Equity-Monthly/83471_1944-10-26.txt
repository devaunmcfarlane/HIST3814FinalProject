Canada's emergence as a prime producer of high-grade iron ore is a fact of tremendous economic significance to our industrial future. The centre of this newlv developing industry exists within the boundaries of Ontario and its growth has been accelerated by the advent of Steep Rock as a shipper of ore to the smelters of Ohio. As new zones of Iron ore deposition are brought to light, especially those which are easily accessible and developable at low cost, we are destined to benefit from a rising industrial prosperity that amply assure r substantial future growth trend.

/ wish to submit the following re-port on your group of Eighteen mining elÍims. situated in Township 176. Sault Ste. Marie Mining Division. Ontario. approximately 18 miles North of the ^dlage of Iron Bridge.
The property is reached bu the White River Road, which is kept in excellent condition by the Provincial Government, from which a road turns off to within two miles of your claims. An easy trail continues from there to your property.
The claims are staked on a very promising Hematite deposit, which has been traced for a distance of three-quarters of a milt over three claims. and shows a well defined deposit of strong continuity of Hematite, ranging from eight feet to twenty feet in width and in one place One Hundred feet from wall to wall. The vein runs a little South of East, going into Stringer Lake on the East, with good showinos of Hematite flote across the lake. On the West side, where stripping is being done, the vein continues in a Jasper conglomerate with plenty of soft material foe a replacement body.
I think that it is the Diabase that has brought in the iron mining a minimum of. a six foot width of this Hematite would show a good profit. Therefore, with widths and continuity *s above stated, it is easy to see that this is a big thing. #
In conclusion. / am very impressed with this deposit. It is the largest Hem-atite body that I have ever seen apart from Steep Rock.

Common Mange Infectious ;
Damages Hogsí Skin
Veterinarians point out that there are two kinds of hog mange, sar-coptic and demodectic. The sarcop-tic form, known as common mange, does most of the damage. The mites burrow into the skin, first around the head and neck and from there spread to the shoulders, back, sides, and hams, causing inflammation and swelling of the skin tissues ¶ skin becomes thickened and develops wrinkles and folds. The infection is contagious and spreads rapidly in a herd when hogs are closely confined.
Sarcoptic mange responds readily to treatment on the farm. Dipping in a medicated bath is the most thorough method of killing the mange mites.´Treated animals should preferably be moved to clean quarters, the veterinarians say, or the old enclosures should be thoroughly cleaned of all litter and then disinfected.
In cold weather when dipping is undesirable, a hog oiler or even a burlap sack fastened around a large stout stake and soaked with crude petroleum or crankcase oil enables hogs to treat themselves with fairly good results as they %ub against i* but this method will not eradicate all the infection.
Their sacrifices mean our security.

CHAPTER VIII
Peggy wondered desperately if she could manage a faint, or a fit. Anything to get Nancy away from the subject of her ring and her engagement. And she would have to keep this up for a week. Each day would call for more details, probably. If she could only go back to this morning when she had had no ring!
ìWell, I can't tell you his name yet,î she answered aloud.
"Won t I meet him while I'm here?' Nancy wanted to know, watching her closely.
"No, you see he doesn't live here. That's why. He's away, and I donít know just when he is coming. Iím awfully sorry but you see that is the way it is. He doesn't live here, and he is coming, but I don't know when, and there arc several complications. í That seemed a good hoc, Peggy told herself, and she had better learn it well. ìCome on, let's go down," she added.
"There seem to be complications,î Nancy muttered as they left her room. They stopped by Peggyís room while she put away her hat, gloves and bag, then went downstairs to join the others on the back terrace for tea.
ter of everything during the rest of the afternoon and evening. Nancy seemed morose, but she always was when she was not the center of things, Peggy thought unhappily. Only once did she enter the conversation.
of heaven to pour us out a bless-
some, but it had not dawned on her that she should have something planned for every minute of Nancyís visit. How could she?
ìYou see itís on account of my engagement. He is frightfully jealous. Perhaps with Maxine here we may be able to fix up something. Iím sorry.î
Nancy pouted in silence the rest of the evening. At quarter to ten Mrs. Holton suggested that it was time for bed, since both guests must be tired. Maxine caught Peggyís eye and smiled. A smile of remembrance. This was the hour when Mrs. Horton always suggested it was time for bed. But the light always burned in her own room long after the other lights were out.Both girls had often wondered why Gran always insisted on going up to bed so early, and then remained awake so late. But no one ever questioned Granís decisions.
Nancy and Peggy talked as they walked back and forth between their rooms while they undressed. At least Peggy talked. She kept up a rapid fire, asking of this girl from hoarding school and telling what she knew of another. She remembered Nancy's disposition of old. She must fix up something for them to do.
(Continued Next Week)
than one. Maybe you do, too.
And we still carry on with out war work. Maybe it isnít so crazj after all. There will always be lift* and leaners. Do you want t< be a leaner? I am sure l don't. The boys arc doing most of the lifting but we can all shove a bit arcord-to our strength and ability.
Farm women surely have their troubles when it comes to doing war work!
Two or thiee weeks ago our Institute decided to hold a euchre and auction sale to raise money for war work. We also decided to make several quilts to be sold. But alas, we didn't take corn bees into consideration. So, last Monday, when wc had two quilts set up and were already to go, so were the corn-cutters! Regrets from Institute members were coming in wholesal
today. Filling silo tomorrow and I must get my baking done.î Or againóT have to take chickens to the city tomorrowóBill can't goóhe has a bid to a corn bee!î So that was that. The few of us who were not tied up with corn bees had to work that much harder. Wc struggled painfully on, working against time and with very sore fingers. We managed two quilts but gave up the ghost on the third.

A Loving God
Some fathers will go to a great deal of trouble and expense to sat-isy the desires of their children, yet it cannot he compared with what the Lord will do for those who love him. A loving father will never give such dangerous things as matches to a child because of the harm they might cause, and a loving God at times docs not grant us the desires of our hearts when it would not be best for us.
"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.î Let us put these words in our book of remembcrancc where they will never be forgotten. Let us not fail to lend a helping hand at every opportunity. Or if we are tempted to pass by a friend in need, reinember the words of Jesus ìAs ye have done it unto one of the least of these my breth-ern, ye have done it unto me.î Words Of Advice It is easy to see the ultimate result of the blind leading the blind, but what of the spiritual application? We who are so fortunate in possessing Godís word, should read it, lest we he lead astray by false teachers. "By their fruits ye shall know them.î Are our guides producing Godly men and women, typical of the straight and narrow way, or individuals like the many who are on the broad way which leadetli down to destruction?
Criticizing was probably as popular in the days of Christ as today. How easy to sec all the faults in our neighbors,, and to overlook all our own shortcomings. May we profit from these words of advice, and consider our way before casting a critical eye at those around us? ìKeep thy tongue from evil.î

"Iíve often been told,'*
Nancy
said, patting her blonde hair, "that 1 am a lot like Carole Landis. Do
you think I am? Iíve sometimes thought I might go into pictures. You remember, Peggy, at school I was always in all the dramatics? Of course, I don't know just how to get in, but you could probably help me there,î she said to Maxine.
ìWell, I'm afraid not,î Maxine answered slowly. ìYou see there arc so many pretty girls who want to get in, and they have such bitter disappointments. I just happened to fit a part they needed someone for, and some studio executive saw me when we were going through a studio, and asked me to come back for a screen test. It was just a break, but of course that doesnít happen often.î
"Have you no other friends in California, Maxine, except these people of the stage with whom you work?î her grandmother asked.
"Oh, yes, of course. But. Gran dear, you must realize that many of the people connected with the ïstudios are delightful. The directors and people like that. 1 wish you knew some of them."

Step On It!
Admiral Halsey tells about getting to a football game late, stepping on a sailor's foot while scrambling to his seat.
The sailor, not looking up. yelled, ìGet off my foot, you big lugî. Then he recognized the admiral, blurted*
ìOh, my goodness, beg pardon, sir. Here's my other foot ó go ahead ó step on it!î

Remember, it's a deliciouc, wholesome cerealónot a medicine. Get ALL-BRAN today, at your grocer's. 2 handy aizes. Made by Kellogg's in London, Canada.
Then came the big dayóFriday óand still there were corn bee complications. A feeling of gloom possessed us. Wc thought the affair was doomed to be a failure But we did just as you would probably have doneówe carried on and hoped for the best. And then, as so often happens, the best was surprisingly good. We netted over a hundred dollars and had lots of fun. There was even a wee puppy for sale.
But the next day was not only the morning after the night before, but the morning after a week of real, hard work.

Maxine, of course, was the ccn-
Mrs. HÙrton shook her head, "No, they do not seem tc have hurt you, but I am afraid they do not appeal to me. 1 have no desire to meet anyone connected with pictures.î
Peggy was silent for the most part. Content to listen, and eagerly awaiting an opportunity to have a talk with her sister.
In the triangle between the service wing which made an ell on the opposite side of the house corresponding to the office, and the terrace, Gran had her herb garden. In the late afternoon the clean spicy odors of sweet marjoram, tansy, thyme, lavender, heliotrope and others that Peggy could never remember, mingled, and she inhaled the fragrance contentedly. "
ìFunny about the way things smell,î she thought to herself, not listening much to the others, just enjoying the fact that Gran and Maxine and she were together again. ìThe linens at boarding school were soapily clean, and you knew you would get up and go to bed and eat by a bell. Here they all smell of lavtnder and heliotrope; and you know the coffee will be hot and served in dainty cups, and that either the sun will be shining or that fires will be burning
in the early morning.î
* * * ï
Each room at Rosewood had its own fireplace, and in the winter a fire was always lighted in the bedroom before its occupant was up. At night, except in summer, Peggy had sleepily watched the fire-light dancing on the walls of her large room ever since she could remember.
After supper, as they were leaving the dining room, Nancy held Peggy back a little after Mrs. Horton and Maxine had left the room.
ìWhat are we doing tonight?î she asked. ì1 am always so curi-when I'm on a blind date.î
ìBut we aren't doing anything, í Peggy told her in confusion.
ìYou mean wc havenít any dates?î Nancy asked, back in shocked surprise, we call up somebody to come over and take us some place or dance here or do something? Why 1
never spend an evening alone.î

Sometimes I think we farm women arc crazy to try doing any war work at all. We have so much to occupy our time. But if we did not make the effort there would be far le<s Red Cross work going overseas because 1 have been told repeatedly that there is a greater proportion of work coming from the country than from urban centres. Making use of the odd minutes is largely a matter of habit. A piece of knitting can easily be picked up as one chats away to casual callers. No apology should be necessary. Rather should an excuse be offered if time be wasted. We can. safely leave time-wasting to the men! If 1 ever see a man making use of spare time other than to puff at a pipe or roll a cigarette, so help me, I shall drop in my tracks.
But of course the men, bless them, don't have any spare time. Well, neither do the women. Not in the country, anyway. We relax by working at something different. Wc wash dishes and then sit down to knit. XX e finish the ironing and then darn the socks. Personally I often darn socks in more ways

Mr. Elliott Little's advice to business men, given in a recent broadcast, that they take more interest in politics and use their influence to shape policies, is exciting considerable comment, says , the Ottawa Journal. We can but trust that those who seem to be interested are not overlooking Mr. Littleís suggestions on. how to take part in politics. Said he:
ìAs a beginning, I suggest you take this simple but important step: Join the local association of the political party of your choice. Attend its meetings... exert an Influence on the selection of the type of candidate who will ultimately stand for office.î
We wonder how many business and professional men ó manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, engineers, school teachers ó belong to the Ottawa associations of the Liberal and Conservative parties. How many of those who may belong to them attend their meetings? And how many will be present when those associations finally meet in convention to nominate candidates for the coming Dominion election?
We would like to think that Mr. Little's advice and exhortations will not fall on barren soil ó but fear greatly that they will. Business and professional, men ó plus many others ó like to talk about what should be done to make politics better, but that, at a rule, is as far as they go ó talk, plus homilies at service club luncheons and high-sounding resolutions by Cham j hers of Commerce and Boards ol Trade.
