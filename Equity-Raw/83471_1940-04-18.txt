The Allies began fighting with their gloves off — on the economic front — as the war with Germany entered Its eighth month. The decision taken by the French and British to use their economic and naval superiority over Germany in an attempt to strangle the Reich, end • the Western Frfhit stalemate and recover the initiative in the war, carried the conflict into a new phase and opened up possibilities ff war in the north, in the Balkans and in the Near East.
NEW STRATEGY Prime Minister Chamberlain’s declaration that henceforth the Allies would wage economic war to the utmost preceded tightening up of the blockade to pinch Germany where it would hurt most with her supplies of iron ore from Scandinavia and edible fats from the Balkans. In this most important action Britain was seen opposed by the neutral nations, chiefly the Scandinavian countries (Sweden warned that any attempt to seize German iron ore ships in Norwegian waters would find the Reich hitting back with a counter-blockade against the Allies), But the Supreme Allied War Council decided that it preferred to run the risk of losing friends among neutral countries than to sacrifice a million lives trying to blast a path through the German Weetwall. The ftrategy adopted wag to use econ-emic strength and seapower in such a way as to squeeze Hitler into a corner, from which he would have choice but to try to fight his way

Tho feeling you describe as spring fever Is probably duo to the fact that the body lias become accustomed to cold weather all winter and too suddenly is called upon to make adjustments to warm weather. Probably tho nerves controlling the blood vessels don't make tho adjustment without upsetting you a bit.
Dr. John C. Scott, profeasor of physiology, at Hahnemann Medical College, thinks the change In blood volume may have something to do with the case.
««You need more blood In warm weather to carry heat from the interior of tho body out to the skin," he said, "it takes about five days for tho body to manufacture the additional blood. Hence, in the first few warm days — before tho extra blood has been produced — you’re like an automobile that doesn't have enough water in the radiator.
"That may partly explain what you call spring fever."
LOW SPEED AFTER DARK
It is a well-established fact that the majority of fatal accidents arc due to speeding, particularly at night. In Kansas City, where a vigorous safety campaign was carried on last year, cutting tho death toll in half, it was found that positive results were not obtained until an after-dark speed limit of 25 miles an hour was established and enforced.

WHY ARE APPLES SCARCE?
Several articles have appeared in this paper about the apple situation and its inconsistencies this year. In spite of a large surplus of apples and the efforts of the Dominion government to help
market their crops, ap-
ready, or sweet peas and flowers which naturally seed themselves. For the medium hardy type of plant, however, there .is no advantage whatever in sowing too soon. There is little growth in any
case ' warm.
Gardeners are advised to divide their seed into at least three parts, sowing a third as soon weather permits, a third a little later, and the balance at the very tail-end of the planting season. In this way if frost does cut down the first batch there will be more plants coming on and the season will be lengthened by the last part of the garden sown.
Rock Gardens
In recent years the rock garden lias become so popular that people are going out of their way to make an excuse for one. They will build their lawns up on two different levels with a rock garden in between.
These gardens are made to resemble miniature alpine ranges, and in them -alpine flowers are grown. These are usually tiny, short, sprawly things, that require little moisture during most of the year. They are specially listed in the better seed catalogues. To hold the sharply sloping soil, fair size rocks of the roughest possible nature, preferably weather-beaten boulders, are buried to about two-thirds their depth irregularly throughout the slope. Good pockets of sandy soil are arranged between the rocks. The flowers find a foothold here and trail over the boulders.
anything goes wrong in your home.
Here, also is valuable information on how to repair and keep in working ordejr all of the most common of household appliances, from sewing machines and food mixtures to burglar alarms. And a complete picture is given of your heating system, water supply, refrigeration and air-conditioning units, and electric power.

WAR WITH RUSSIA?
The fear of approaching war with Russia (as well as with Germany) abated somewhat last week when the affair of the seizure of Russian vessels in the Pacific was soft-pedalled; when rumors of a new Russo-British trade rapprochement flew about; and when Soviet Premier Molotoff proclaimed Russia's desire to "maintain our neutrality and to refrain from any participation in the war". At the same time Russia denied intention to wrest her lost province of Bessarabia from Rumania by war.

In addition to the regular waters for game fishing from coast to coast, new fishing lakes have been discovered and opened to sports-

Comfort, conservatism and quality may be said to be the three essentials most desired by men in their suits and topcoats this spring.
For the first time in some years, American fashion is coming into its own. With Europe at war and with its mills and manufacturing houses operating under wartime conditions, the American fashion originator has a great opportunity of producing and popularizing his
own merchandise.
MORE ROUGH MATERIALS Results of this condition are seen in the decline of the English influence on men's clothes. This spring suits are cut with wide shoulders, lots of arm room and trousers built to wear well and fit easily.
There is an upturn in the use of rough materials. Tweeds and shetlands that were seen in the country and at sports events are now coming into their own for office wear and business use.
THE WAR WEEK
Shortly after U. S. Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles arrived back in Washington, President Roosevelt declared he "saw scant hope for peace" in Europe at the present time. Germany officially charged, during the same week, that the United States policy had had a big part in causing the citing contents of documents seized In the Polish foreign office arch-

Mr. Poole, for there is in Canada a species of fish to suit the taste every class of angler. All these species are not found in the same waters, nor even in the same province, but each has its habitat somewhere In Canada.
The French army has opened a recruiting station for army dogs.
Dogs will be accepted either as gifts or on loan for the duration of the war. They will be concentrated at a training camp, where they will receive special instruction, which, in a few weeks, will turn them into specialists for patrol work. Red Cross, dispatch carriers, or for observation duty.
ALSATIANS, SHEEP DOGS
Alsatian police and sheep dogs are preferred because they have a natural camouflage color and because their natural talents approach nearest to those of wolves.
During training each dog is also handled by only one soldier, who later controls him at the front.
THEY CARRY DISPATCHES
Dispatch carriers are trained to run from advance posts to company battalion or regimental headquarters, making use of trenches or covered terrain where they escape being seen or shot.
They carry messages in a pouch worn around the collar. Red Cross dogs are trained to find wounded soldiers and lead stretcher bearers to them.
If there arc enough volunteers, France will maintain an army of 1,000 dogs.

Bobby Connor, nine-year-old boy tenor, does not consider himself a child prodigy but has the same ambition as Eddie Johnson of Guelph—to sing in the Metropolitan Opera.
The Newtonbrook (Ont.) boy has startled music critics with his voice and retentive musical memory. He sang over a Toronto radio j station when only two years old , and readily picks up every musi" cal instrument that comes within his reach. On his mother's piano he plays classical selections by ear and his teachers have not yet attempted to have him read music because his memory is so retentive that he can reproduce any selection he has heard two or three times.

It is felt that in this way public opinion will be secured and the Fish and Game affairs of this province also the Tourist business will not be carried out on the advice of a select few in each district who in many cases have _ personal interest at stake, This request has received the support of all other similiar associations in the Pro-
Though the perpetual search for Ersatz in Germany may be a testimony to German ingenuity, it is proof of the penury of German economy. There is even a shortage of the substitutes themselves, and the list of Ersatz products that may be used for making Ersatz coffee grows daily shorter and shorter.
Clothing has long since been rationed. Yet the quantity grow s scarcer and the quality steadily worse.
One of the most convincing signs of Germany’s economic weakness is the condition of her export trade. The British “blockade” has shut her off from overseas markets, but certain aspect of her continental trade to countries to which she still has access reveal her internal economic enfecblement.
There is, for example, the decree by which all motor cars leaving Germany have to leave their tires behind them at

The Fish Committee of this Association have lequested the Quebec Government to plant the following quantities of Fish and Species in the waters of Pontiac County and similiar quantities and species in the Counties of Gatineau and Papineau, each year for fifteen years :— Speckled Trout, 20,000,000 ; Gray Trout, 20,000,000 ; Brown Trout, 500,000 ; Rainbow Trout, 1,000,000 ; Bass, 10,000,000 ; Pickerel 10,000,000 ; A total of ninety-one million five hundred thousand in each county.
When the program of restocking of Quebec waters for the past twenty-five years is studied this looks like a very-large order, but compared with the program being carried out by Ontario and other provinces and nearby states the request is a very modest one indeed.
Fish conditions in the accessible waters of this district are now so serious that it is everybody» business to that the present Sportsmens and Tourist and Summer residental business. It looks and has looked for some years to our directors that the only way to get immediate action is by Mr. Godbout setting up a good active commission immediately. In the mean time every resident can do much by giving their fullest co-operation to the new staff of Fish and Game and "Fire Wardens in your district. The re-oiganizition of th^ enforcement staff is now going on, and here is hoping that results will be attained.

By contrast, the Allies have abundant supplies of rubber. In 1938 the British and French Empires produced some 55 per cent, of the total world output, and they obtain considerable foreign exchange by selling rubber to the United States.
Conditions, too, in the German steele industry are such that German steele for export may no longer be strengthened with nickel. Even for her own armourplate and aircraft requirements Germany is deficient in nickel. She can neither produce it nor obtain it in any appreciable quantities. Nearly 90 per cent, of the world output comes from Canada, and most of the rest from Burma and French New Calendonia.
In an attempt to relieve this shortage, Germany recently called in all her nickel coins—a procedure which will have yielded some 1,500 tons, or the equivalent of Germany’s normal sumption of nickel in two months of

Germany’s problems are further revealed when it is remembered that it is now common German practice not to export finished articles unless the foreign buyer has supplied the raw material for them. Thus, German tinplate mills refuse to supply neutral countries with plates unless the latter provide the tin.
Once again the* contrast, with the Allied position is striking. In 1938. the British Empire produced 62,000 tons of tin, or nearly 40 per cent, of the world total. Not only can the Allies

The letter was elated January 10, 1808. Jefferson set forth that he wouldn’t run for a third term because “that I should lay down my charge at a proper period is as much j a duty as to have borne it faith- , fully.
“Believing that a representative government responsible at short pe- B riods of election is that which produces the greatest sum of happiness to mankind, I feel it a duty to do no act which shall essentially im- ç pair that principle, and I should unwillingly be the person who, disregarding the sound precedent set by ^ illustrious predecessor, should furnish the first example of prolongation beyond the second term of )ffice.”

‘Surplus Food’ Lunches
Provide Balanced Diets
' Fortunately for the many children receiving lunches under the school-lunch program, the surplus foods available for these lunches are largely the very foods needed to balance their diets, the Federal Surplus Commodities corporation reports.» The principal surplus food products that the corporation has handled include butter, eggs in some areas, a considerable number of fresh vegetables and fruits—especially citrus fruits—and some canned goods as well as such staples as flour, corn meal, and cereals. The official surplus list has thus Included a good allowance of the protective foods, desirable in all diets but particularly necessary for young children.
A school lunch program is always a co-operative activity. The federal agency delivers surplus commodities to the state welfare agency which arranges with local sponsors of the lunch program—usually the school, a local welfare unit, or the Parent-Teachers organization. WPA furnishes labor if the sponsors need help.
The sponsors usually have to buy other supplies on local markets, but the distribution of surplus foods that the corporation buys when the wholesale markets cannot absorb them at fair prices provides a starting point that has encouraged this form of co-operative effort.
Last year the school lunch program was in effect in 14,000 different schools and more than 800,000 children received the lunches. Officials hope that the number will be 5,000,000 by the end of the present school year.

Serious Eye Defects
Are Highway Menace
Periodic inspection of automobiles is reducing automobile accidents in many states. Defective brakes, im-propei headlights and wobbly wheels ^ are detected and the owners of such 2 cars art* prevented from using the public highways until such defects arc corrected.
Unfortunately for highway safety, there are no regular check-ups on automobile drivers, despite the fact that statistics show that more than half of all Americans have serious eye defects by the time they reach ^ their forties.
Motorists’ eyes do not stay in good shape indefinitely, any more than do their automobiles. About half of the states now have some sort of eye tests for driver applicants, although none of such tests are very rigid, according to the Setter Vision institute. In some states a person actually may be half-blind before he is required to wear spectacles when driving to protect the public. But ,, none of the states require periodic * check-ups of drivers' eyes.
If automobile driverr were required to have their eyes checked every few years, highway safety * would be increased. A person with ^ changing eyes then would not have f to run into another car to know that his eyes needed tightening up.

Leaves Point Out Gold
Permission to operate in Sweden has been granted to a company formed to exploit a new prospecting method developed by two scientists,
Dr. Nils Brundin and Dr. Sven Palmquist, of Stockholm. They say ^ it is possible to ascertain whether ^ on area contains minerals by labo- 3 ratory examinations of tree leaves. 1 pine needles and the like. Trees and shrubs suck up the water solutions in which minerals leave their trace. For example, trees growing near a gold vein reveal certain gold contents in their leaves. Before definite results can be obtained borings must be made, and magnetic and electric surveying are also employed. The inventors have experienced with success in England.

‘Don’t Give Up the Ship’
The overcrowded canoe, the swamped rowboat, the capsized sailboat have brought grief to many a holiday. And the slogan here is the old law of the sea: “Do the ship.” Canoes and rowboats will always float and it is safer to cling to them until rescued than to attempt to swim to a shore that looks near but seems ever farther away as the swimmer’s strength begins to ebb, writes William Henry Wri.j’'- n the Springfield Republican. .uiy craft that continues to float w 11 enable boy or man to keep head above water, and frequently wind or current drift will carry all safely to shallow water even though no help romes.

ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein. The New Testament, when God’s love for us is emphasized not only speaks of that love manifested toward us through Jesus Christ, God’s Son, but brings out the truth that we fundamentally know God’s love to through Christ only because He died for us.

A Farmer Plans His Spring Work
While modern aids to agriculture have taken much of the guess out of “What will the harvest be?” spring on the farm is always an adventure, when one contemplates the mystery of life as it bursts forth anew in herb and tree.
In Preparation
John Biown believes in prepared, and his spring campaign began with the careful overhauling of his combination grain and fertilizer drill, making sure that the working parts were clean and movable. As an added precaution he applied some coal-oil to the mechanism and then a few drops of lubricating oil. Next, he and his helper got the fanning mill going and cleaned the seed grain, treating it afterwards with the ethyl mercury phosphate dust as protection against smut and root rots.
RETURN TO GOD Hos. 6:1. Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 2. After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up and we shall live before him. 3. And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah ; his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto the rain, as the latter rain
IT is known that the sense of smell is highly developed in fish, and it is believed that this sense, combined with that of touch, plays a much greater role in the securing of food than docs the sight sense. The latter sense of fish seems to be limited more or less to the perception of changing lights and shadows.
NEXT: What is the average area of the 48 states?
DOES DOUBLE DUTY
The kitchen does duble duty, it serves as a cooking centre, and at the same time it is a storage place for dishes, utensils, cleaning materials and other household gadgets and equipment. Sufficient space for storage is of vital importance in the planning of a kitchen for a small modern home.
The advent of the breakfast nook is rapidly turning the kitchen into a room of increasing social usage. For the quick breakfast or aftertheatre snack the breakfast nook or ‘ bar” as it is sometimes called is pretty hard to beat. Practically every modern home is equipped with a special spot for serving quick meals.

Research by physicists and bacteriologists indicated that swimming pools in the future will be sterilized with small amounts of silver instead of with chlorine.
Further application of the revolutionary form of germ killing may provide a substitute, they said, for pasteurization of milk.
Leading biologists, and agriculturists of the U. S. rail the discovery epoch-making that gas instead of sprays is effective in combatting plant diseases. They say it is the most important step in plant doctoring since Millardet nearly 100 year* discovered Bordeau mixture, grandfather of sprays.
Kven more significant, they say, is the fact that gas treatment cures. Never before have plants been cured. Sprays and other crop control methods are preventives. The gas is both preventive and cure.

A lady of curious countenance had married a Scotsman, and after the ceremony he approached the parson with some trepidation. "How much do I owe for this?” he asked.
The parson, also a Scotsman, knew his business. "How much is it worth to you?” he countered.
The bridegroom blushed, gave a sidelong glance at the parson, and pressed a shilling into his palm. The parson looked at the shilling, then at the bride, and him eightpence change.

PERIODIC EXAMINATION
A certain group to whom periodic examination is made available as a matter of routine, have been found to experience a mortality only about one-half that of the general population in corresponding age classes. In 1914 a well-known insurance company decided to institute periodic medical examinations of all its employees. Treatment is given only in emergency. The plan followed is to help forpi a correct diagnosis and then to place the information at the disposal of the family physician where occasion arises. The employee receives a reminder once a year.
The members of the group number some 18,000, all clerical, and of the total two-thirds are females and of a younger average age than the men.
Death Rate Much Lower
The practice of routine periodic examination not only lowers the deathrate very materially but it furnishes invaluable sources of medical information not otherwise obtainable. Persons going to a medical man are more or less seriously ill; the majority going up for periodic examination are not ill at all. But among the lot some will be found to have illnesses more or less defined. Often the routine examination will discover illness at a stage when it can be nipped in the bud.
The deaths among the 18,000 in 1938 numbered 68 and of these 28 occurred at ages of 66 or over. This is equivalent to a crude deathrate of 6.1 deaths per 1000 for males and 2.3 for females or a combined rate of approximately 4 per 1000. The average for the past 10 years has been 4.3 per 1000. (Canada’s rate for 1938 was 9.6 per 1000).
