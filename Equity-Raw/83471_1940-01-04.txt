Shawville Boys’ Band, under the direction of Mi*. W. 11. Finlayson, ‘ of Ottawa, presented their annual Christmas concert in the Theatre on Thursday night, and citizens who failed to attend missed one ot the most pleasing musical entertainments given in Shawville lor some time.
A vast improvement was noted in each section of the Band, and reflected great credit to Mr. Fin Jayson who has been instructing for the past two months.
A.varied program of Band selections was presented and each number made a decided hit with the audience which was not as large the young musicians expected or deserved.
Trumpet solos by Mr. Fmlayson were particularly well received, as was also a cornet duet by John Brough and Geo, licid ; a clarinet solo hy Cameron liowat and a trombone solo by Karl Garrety, with piano accompaniments by Miss Fmlayson

The Second Great War broke a record In its fifteenth week — for excitement. Two events, one of unexcelled dramatic interest, the other world-shaking in importance, held the spellbound attention of newspaper readers, radio hounds, of all Countries. We refer to the 'suicide” of the Graf Spee, the pulsion of Russia from the League of Nations;
What a wealth of speculation hinged on these 2 happenings! Mad Hitler himself ordered the scuttling of the Spee? Was it a gesture of gros bravado, blown up in order that the secret» of her construction might not fall Into enemy hands? With regard to the action taken at Geneva, many thinking people felt regret and annoyance that the League had not seen fit previously to do something lbout the aggressions of Hitler, the rape of Albania by Mussolini. (The League had never even dismissed the disappearance of Aus-Czechoslovakia or Poland from the map). Looking ahead, too, the world wondered whether Russia's expulsion would not throw the USSR, and Germany closer together.

A call for a complete overhauling of the province’s relief system as it affects the rural areas was made in Woodstock by Thomas Phillips, superintendent of the Norfolk Children’s Aid Society addressing a meteing of the Woodstock Rotary Club.
“This question lias now entered the realm of big business,’* said Mr. Phillips, “and it is time to take its administration away from the municipalities that are ill-equipped to raise the necessary taxation or to appoint persons skilled enough to administer such a problem. Federal and provincial participation have made the lot of municipalities easier but the machinery is creaking badly.”
Mr. Phillips advocated that outside of the large urban centres no unit for relief should be less than country-wide and the administration placed in charge of specially trained persons.

]. It may be called a disease, but it is not deadly. The proverb says, “If pride were a deadly disease, how many would now be in their graves.” According to I.a Rochefoucauld, “Pride is equal in all men ; the only difference is the means and manner of displaying it.'' 2.

Write -a personal note to each one.



advised in an address at Sarnia. Ont., by W. K. Riddell, agricultural representative for Middlesex County.
Canada's reputation for certain types of quality goods was lost during the World War through the neglect of farmers to maintain the standard of quality in the haste to produce in huge quantities, noted Mr. Riddell.
During the present conflict, the speaker advised, “produce in the largest quantities those things that are needed most, but maintain the quality of the products.”
WINTER SHORT COURSES
Wednesday, December 27th, saw many hundreds of wide awake young farmers hastening to the city of Guelph to register at the O. A. C. for one or other of the timely and practical short courses commencing the following morning. Running concurrently, there are five aoutrses of two weeks duration, on the following lines: Animal Husbandry, Farm Mechanics, Horticulture, Bee keeping, and Co-operation. Beginning on the same day there four weeks course in Poultry Husbandry. In similar courses last winter there were more than 800 men and women registered. Most

of them were young men, but there were a number of women in the Horticulture, Poultry, and Beekeeping courses. These courses are open to all residents of Ontario.
I.arg.j numbers of Canadian men ready to serve in the present war who for various reasons or another ars not eligible for admission into the Active Service Forces are being recruited for service in the Legion of ' Frcntiersmtm, an organization granted a Dominion charter in 1934, whose duties involve reinforcing the civil ' authorities, in time of national emergency. A Frontiersman, to be fitted for service, must be given training ' in police laWf,. duties; fire protection and extinction, anti-air raid precautionary service, first aid, military dri.I etc., so that he stands within the community as a trained reserve, ready to reinforce the authorities in case-of necessity. The Dominion Headquarters are at Edmonton, and the present Divisional Commandant is Lieut.-Col. Louis Scott, D.C.M. The various provinces are governed by a Provincial Commandant, the Headquarters for Ontario being located at Toronto, under the present supervision of Major G. R. N. Collins, Senior Of.icer within the Province. (P.O. Box 4, Station “A" Toronto). Squadrons of the Legion exist in every Province and it most of the large centres. It is hoped to organize units in smaller centres.
Ontario Rains Help Farmers
»
Rain that was fairly general all throughout Ontario the first week in December, gave farmers relief from a monfch-longn drought which left wells and creaks low, and In extreme cases dry rain was fairly substantial — just under half an inch — further precipitation will be needed if an acute water shortage is to be averted.
Wells and creeks were lowest iu central and-southwest Ontario. The drought left the land hard and farmers. taking advantage of the late fall weather to do their plowing, found the going difficult.
There were some instances of fall wheat suffering from lack of rain, but conditions generally as reported to the Ontario Department of Agriculture were good with a satisfactory top on the crop. Most reports said the growth so far was good and would be well abie to stand normal winter weather.

(National Geographic Society)
The National Geographic Society has just published the book every fisherman has been waiting for. Written by recognized authorities on marine life, the eleven chapters of this entrancing new volume are a treasure-house of information, accurate yet nontechnical, presented in a popular, pleasing way.

This new “Book of Fishes” is available at cost, and can be had by writing to the National Geographic Society, Dept. FF-2. Washington, D C. Price, $3.75

OXYGEN APPLIED TO JOINTS
"Ballooning" of infected and broken bone joints with oxygen to bring about quick and effective healing is reported.
The joints actually are blown up like a toy balloon, after enough fluid has been withdrawn to create an air space.
The treatment was designed to separate the parts of the bone and tissue which sometimes adhere and cause a stiff joint, and also to aid healing by putting oxygen in direct contact with the bone as it grows back together. This stimulates the repairing process.	I

PREVENTATIVE FOR SILICOSIS
Electrons have revealed a clue to the way to prevent silicosis, a disease in which the tissues of the lungs are disintegrated by inhalation of air in which silica dust is suspended. Silica is a common rock-to ruling material. It was observed in experiments on rabbits that If they breathed air in which there was a moderate concentration of silica dust they contracted the disease, but if the air contained some aluminum powder, a bout 1 per cent, of the weight of the silica, the animals did not contract the disease.

Fear that fellow prisoners would take vengeance on him because he had betrayed his fellow partners in crime caused John Strong to hang himself in his cell in Pentridge jail, in Melbourne, Australia. Strong was serving a five-year sentence for complicity in a daring holdup. At his trial he was branded as a Judas who had sold his fellow criminals for 20 pieces of silver by betraying the others to a detective. This sc preyed on his mind after his.conviction that he asked the jail officials to protect him from the other prisoners. This they did. but his nerves became more frayed each day until he could stand it no longer.

Professor Visscher ; eotch-em-a!ive trap.-, w found that when the heart can no grown elk and antelope ha lcr.gcr spurt out blood it tries to transplanted Just last fai adapt itself to new conditions, di- leavers were moved intc Kt 'ales and enlarges.

So :r.ough to repopulate a stat more blood is delivered on contrac- | ;nany thriving color tier.—exactly as much blood as the heart receives.

Cat, Dog Rated Equals
’ On Intelligence Scale
The only difference in the intelligence of a dog and a cat is that a dog is ‘ something vf a socialist while a cat is an individualist cording to Dr. Charles M. Diserens. assistant professor of psychology at the University of Cincinnati.
Diserens, who has made a
life-long study of cats persons who favor dogs over cats or who believe dogs have a higher degree of intelligence just don’t know their cats. He believes one animal if about as intelligent as the other and that there is httie difference in their nerve centers.
Although classifying cats as rugged individuals. Dr. Diserens wants it understood that felines have a genuine capacity for gratitude. He says this fact may often be noted during and after medical treatment they become deeply grateful and very often more affectionate.
Pilots Hit Billion Miles
Airplane pilots licensed by the commerce department have passed the billion mark in mileage flown, according to a study of the department’s records. The records of the department's aeronautics branch show all flying time accumulated by licensed pilots and from these records it is estimated that these airmen have flown approximately 1,05*1,000,000 miles. Flying by those carried on the * records as transport pilots, the highest type licensed bv the department, accounted fur approximately 11 twelfths of the total, the remaining twelfth having been credited to private, limited commercial and industrial pilots, in that order.

The triumvirate of car owner, engineer and manufacturer are agreed on one thing—present car speeds are adequate for both town and country driving.

But, the engineers assert, there will be no demand for more speed until there has been a great deal of change on transcontinental highways.
It was the consensus that transmissions show a widespread indication of becoming overdrive, both automatic and manual. Introduction of the fluid flywheel is bound to have a marked effect, the engineers agreed, although here the factor of cost is to be considered.

Opposition To Christ
We discover in this lesson the rising opposition to the Lord Jesus Christ, which finally led to the cross. We are living in a day when there is a similar rising tide of opposition to the Christ of the New Testament, and it is interesting to see here the characteristics and manifestations of such opposition which are parallelled by the antagonism against Christ which we find today on every hand. Christ won when he was on earth, and Christ will win in the conflict against him today.

WELCOME TO 1940
NBC broadcasts the ten biggest news stories of the year at 2 p.m. EST., on New Year's Eve under the	heading	of	“Headlines of
1939." Thp program will be in dramatic form and will last for one hour. Needless to say there has been more than enough material to make up the script. It will not all be war material, however, for there is the tragedy of the	Squalus,	the	Corrigan	and
Hughes flights and	the new	Eng-
land hurricane to draw upon.
A minute before the New Year begins (11.59 p.m. EST., on December 31, 1939) Mutual microphones will be opened up on Times Square. New York City, to catch Broadway’s welcome to 1940. All	networks	will	parade	their
dance bands the same evening on an overnight celebration. For five hours from 11 p.m., EST., the boys will keep the music going.
NOTES AND NEWS
New shows for 1940 include revivals of Cavalcade of America and Grand Hotel, and, for the first time, a quiz program called “What Would You Have Done Grand Hotel drama series begins on January 7. The new quiz hour opens on January 2C> with Ed Hcr-lihy, NBC announcer, as M.C. Charles Boyer, released from service in the French Army, takes back the star role in the Holly-

Murder of John Baptist
Matt. 14. 1. At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, 2. and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore do these powers work in him. 3. For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, end put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s ""wife. 4. For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. The death of Christ’s herald was a certain portent of the rejection and crucifixion of the King. (The Herod of our lesson, called Herod Antipa?, was the son of Herod the Great who ordered the slaughter of the babes of Bethlehem). Herod, knowing that he was wrong in this marriage with his brother's (still living) wife, and too weak a man to resist the will of Salome and her scheming mother, Herod gave orders for John the Baptist to be executed. Jesus immedja ely withdrew into a desert place on being Informed of the martyrdom of his forerunner by whom he had been baptized.

Not Because He’s Happy — Explanation Not Yet round
My little old Irish terrier, chased a rat into a crevice of a stone wall, a few minutes ago, writes Albert Pay son Terhune, expert on dogs. She is standing crouched in eager quest in front of the hole. Her stumpy tail is wagging violently. Why is her tail wagging? She is not happy. Indeed, she was chagrined that the rat should have reached the hole before she could kill it.
1 have seen a dog, furiously engaged in a death-battle with another and larger dog, and with his |‘ tail wagging just as hard. The dog was in pain. He was facing death. So why did he wag his tail? I don't know. Do YOU?
Wags When Happy
Twice, 1 have seen fine dogs beaten by their masters; and standing staulelike under the punishment, with their plumed tails awag. 1 saw one of my dogs lying with his left foreleg broken in two places by a car. As l ran up to him he wagged his tail.
We have been told since our childhood that the wagging of a dog’s tail is a sign he is happy. Yet 1 have seen unhappy and badly injured dogs do that same thing. What did any of them have to be happy about? Nothing.
