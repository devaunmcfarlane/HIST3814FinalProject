The King s Proclamation
Once more, in these critical days, our King George VI, has summoned the people to help the Empire in its hour of need by joining together in their various religious congregations tor services ot penitence, deep humility before God and prayer. He realizes the truth of the Divine promise, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strenght.” Accordingly the King has set aside Sunday, Sept. 8th, as a Day of Prayer throughout the Empire.
He urges all people to gather in their churches to confess their sins and to wait upon God. Surely all patriotic people, all citizens of the great Empire now battling for its life against greaj odds and for the democracy of the world will be glad to accept the King’s challenging invitation.

10. He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us after Iniquities.

For a* the heavens are high above the earth, so great Is his lovlng-kind-toward them that fear him. The distance of the heavens from the earth is no more immeasurable than the greatness of God's mercy to those that put their trust in him and are obedient to him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Sin Is removed from us by a miracle of love.

But the loving-kindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him. and his righteousness unto children’s children.

The Annual Totem Pole Go if Tournament will take place over the Jasper Park Lodge course at Jasper, Alberta, from September 1 to 7 inclusive, according to Joseph Van Wyck, general manager of hotels, Canadian National Railways. “This tournament, which is played over a magnificent scenic 18-hole course laid in the Athabaska Valley in the heart of the Canadian Rockies, promises to be the most successful yet staged over this picturesque course,” he said.
Picturesque Course
Representing fhe grand finale of the season’s activities at Jasper Park Lodge, this week on the g-een has now become an institution and ranks as the outstanding annual golfing event in the Pacific Northwest according to Mr. Van Wyck. “The tournament is exclusively for amateurs and all players take part in a qualifying round during the first two days. Women are assured of the same number of games as the men, with many opportunities for friendly matches. The men’s Totem Pole Championship Final is played over 36 holes; all other flights for both men and women are 18-hole matches.”
Round Trip Arrangements
It is announced that arrangements have been made for all-inclusive rates over the Canadian National Railways for the benefit of golfers participating in this event. These rates cover round-trip transportation, standard sleeping car occupancy, seven days accommodation to the Lodge and return.

CAMPAIGN FOR HEALTH
“At this time of Empire crisis, k calls on all Canadians to shake off that apathy, to fight it in others, and to join hands in a determined effort to make preventable sickness a thing unknown in the Dominion, to raise the national standard of heatlh and efficiency, and to make it possible for every Canadian man and woman to take a full share in our national war effort” so states the Honourable Mr. Justice Riddell, President ' of the Health League of Canada in “A Message to Canadians in Wartime” printed in the current issue of the magazine “Health.”
Mr. Justice Riddell’s message reads: “A few days ago, the Honourable J. Harold Kirby, K.C., Ontario’s Minister of Health, stated publicly that a concerted health programme at this time is of the first importance if Canada is to prosecute the war efficiently.

To a generation now counting the grey heirs, the personification of guid Scots thrift was that genial comedian, Sir Barry La-uder. knew the value of a bawbee as few others even of his countrymen did, and in a lifetime of trouping he put the knowledge to good nee.

A fighting plane of the British Royal Air Force c oastal command hovers over a convoy of merchant •hips which are bringing supplies to England. With Germany making desperate attempts to blockade England with motor torpedo boats and bombing planes, the coastal fliers have the responsibility for seeing that the «envoys get through. In the past week or so attacks on convoys such as this one have brought great air battles. Some 600 German planes are said to have been engaged in one fight this week.

His rules for thrift were proverbial in decades past They might we!l be brushed tip and brought to light now, writes Ann Rutherford, in the Stratford Beacon-Herald.
Here they are, all ten of them, as applicable now as when they were first pronounced:
“1. Behave toward your purse as you would your best friend.
“2. View the reckless money spender as a criminal and shun his company.
“3. Dress neatly, not lavishly. A bank pays a higher rate of Interest than your back.
"4. Take your amusements judiciously. You will enjoy them better if you do.
"5. Don't throw away your crusts — eat them. They are as strengthening as beef.
“6. It is more exhilarating to feel money in your pocket than beer la your stomach.

Must Keep Skin Clean In Summer

Q. How can I make a needle book in which the needles will not rust?
A. An ideal needle book is one that is made of chamois instead of flannel, as the needles will not rust in the chamois.
Q. How can I mix whitewash?
A. Fill a bucket half full of lime and cover it about two inches with water. Let stand 24 hours to slack, or until it is the consistency of paste. Dip out a portion of this slaBked lime into another bucket and thin with water to the desired consistency. Add one teaspoonful of bluing to % bucket of whitewash to clear and make whke, and % pint of salt to make it stick.
Q. How can I retain the original stiffness of cretonnes after washing them?
A. If the cretonnes are rinsed in water in which rice has been boiled, they will retain their original stiffness.
Q. How can I prepare a good toilet water?
A. An excellent toilet water can be made by mixing two ounces of elder flower water with an equal quantity of distilled water.
Q. How can I cause nails to stay more firmly in plaster walls?
A. After driving the nails into the plaster wall, pull them out, wrap with a little steel wool, and then drive them in again.
No doubt you have noticed how shiny your skin gets in summer. People with greasy skins are battling agalnt an unbecoming shine; even those with dry or normal complexions find it hard work to keep their make-up smooth and matt in the heat of the sun. Shininess alone is bad enough, but the trouble does not stop at that! A shine indicates that the surface of the skin le very sticky, and dirt and duet accumulate very easily on a sticky surface. The warmth of the atmosphere also tends to relax your pores; so that the grime is able to work right Into your skin. Black-heads for you, if you don’t look out!
CLEAN THRICE A DAY Never Is skin-cleansing so important as It is in the summer. You should clean it three, even four times a day during the warm weather.
WAR AFFECTS RESEARCH
World activity in chemical research has slumped about 13 per cent since the outbreak of the European war in September of hat year, according to a report by Professor E. J. Crane of Ohio State University to the Am-ercian Chemical Society.
The decline, as reflected in the scientific, technical, and trade publications of all nations, compares with a drop of about 24 per cent in the year following the beginning of the World War in 1914, says Professor Crane.
Sickness—Fifth Column
“Too much emphasis cannot be laid upon this fact. Annually thousands of dollars are wasted, and thousands of working days lost because of sickness which is •entirely preventable. This waste must be stopped and this condition rectified. Both money and man-power are needed now for the defence of Canada and the Empire.
“Neglect of health is a ^fifth-column” activity no less than more open and more spectacular forms of sabotage ; and ignorance of simple health rules cannot be allowed to excuse such flagrant neglect of common prudence.
“The Health League of Canada has carried on an active and determined campaign for public health during many years, and has succeeded in accomplishing great things in spite of the apathetic attitude of many of our citizens.”

BED-BUG BRINGS SLEEP
Discovery of a bedbug which Insures Bound sleep—but the wrong kind week by the U. S. public health service.
The bug, which is the “grandfather” of all bedbugs because It is several times larger than the ordinary insects, carries the germ of sleeping sickness from man to man and from animals to men.

A very sceptical man frequently went fishing — but only because he liked to say they weren't biting. And ho never used bait because he didn’t believe anything would grab it, anyway.
One day came the big surprise. He cast his line, and there was a sudden jerk. Something grabbed that line and then started off towards the other end of the lake.
The sceptical man fought that fish all the afternoon. Finally he landed the biggest trout ever taken in those waters. Puffing heavily, he gazed down at his prize that nearly swamped the boat.
"It’s a lie!” he snorted. And he rolled it overboard.

(By G. C. Toner) FORESTS AND FISHES
The fishery biologist is vitally concerned with forests. He knows HvM trees and woodlands catch and hold the water during the time of the year when precipitation is high, releasing it gradually during the summer. In forested regions the spring floods are gentle; the streams run throughout the year, cool and elear; erosion with its consequent sût is held to a minimum. Simply e stated, to have fish, there must he trees over a considerable portion of the watershed that supplies the streams.
Right Temperature
The existence of the brook trout in Ontario is closely dependent on the forests. Like all ether creatures they have certain definite physical and chemical requirements of the environment hi which they live. Of these, temperature of the water seems to have great power as a limiting factor. If the water in the stream is too warm, there will be no trout; if too cold, the food is scanty or non-existent and again there will be few or no trout. This temperature range is quite narrow, from 46 degrees to 66 degrees with a variation, either way of 6 degrees, and within ! these limits the trout passes its whole existence.
Tree» Along Streams
Water from the earth is usually at 66 degrees, winter or summer. This is close to the most suitable temperature for the speckled trout. In shaded valleys the spring-fed stream is protected from the sun and wind but in the open fields it soon warms. Trees along the watercourses are an insurance against warm water, so a landowner, to keep conditions right for the trout, should plant trees along the valley, close to the stream, and should protect those that are already there.

China Suffers Three Years
The undeclared war between Japan and China entered its third year during the week. In commemoration of its outbreak, General Chiang Kai-Shek delivered a message to the Chinese people which reaffirmed his determination to carry on the fight against Japan until “all Chinese soil has been freed of the invader." Four days later Japanese bombers again attacked the Chinese capital Chungking with resulting inestimable loss of lif at least 25,000 persons were rendered homeless as incendiary bombs started uncontrolled fires in a large section of the city, dye bath that will contain enough liquid to cover the garment completely without crowding.

spect of the Russian Air Force allow him to do so." (It was believed Mr. Churchill was suggesting that Hitler might refuse to send his air force against Britain in a long-sustained campaign for fear its ranks would be decimated, leaving Germany at <he mercy of Russia’s numerically powerful air force).

Huge Reductions Indicated ss Result of Invasion

Victory, Or Stalemate
That Hitler would have to achieve a victory over Britain by mid-September, or stalemate in the war was the opinion of Associated Press correspondent Kirke L. Simpson who pointed out that within a few weeks bad weather would be the general rule in the North Sea and the English Channel climaxed by equinoctial storms of unpredictable force and duration.
During the week Germany proclaimed a “total blockade" of the British Isles, blockade were Ireland and all coastal waters aaound Hritain. The area specified began on the French Atlantic coast approximately at the mouth of the Loire, extended right around the British Isles to North Scotland and down the British east coast, reaching the Continent again at the coast of Belgium.
Eastern Hot-Spots
Developments in the Middle East were expected hourly last week. The long-awaited assault on Egypt by Italy was believed not far off, led perhaps by an aerial attempt to conquer Aden, British-held eastern hinge of the gateway to the Red Sea (British Somaliland constituted the western hinge).
Tension in the Balkans also increased with a double-barrelled Axis drive in prospect, Italy to jump on Greece; Germany to march into Yugoslavia. But behind the scenes forces were believed working to prevent such a push towards the Dardanelles and the east. Russia plainly was encouraging Greece and Turkey to resist an Italian advance through Greece; which might result in Hitler calling Mussolini off before he would take a chance on having to fight Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, Russia and possibly Bulgaria.
In order to prevent war breaking out in Southeastern Europe at this time, Hitler appeared to be exerting pressure on Hungary to accept Rumania’s final answer with regard to the disposition of Transylvania (King Carol offered

New C&nada-U. S. Agreement On Defense Is Momentous
British-U.S. Union?
The Ogdensburg agreement was followed immediately by a sensational move on the part of Britain. Speaking in the House oi Commons, Prime Minister Churchill stated that 99-year leases of sea and air bases in Newfoundland, Atlantic Islands (perhaps a reference to Bermuda) and West Indian points had been offered to the United States. Next day British foreign office sources confirmed reports that the United States had leased the Islands of Canton and Enderby (midway between Hawaii and Australia) from Great Britain as air bases.
Seeds of the Future
These developments gave an impetus to movements in both Great Britain and the United States working for union of the two great powers. Many prophets envisioned a coming world in which five mammoth groups of countries (English, German, Russian, Japanese, Italian) would struggle amongst themselves for trade, combine and re-combine against one another to keep a balance of power.
In his same speech to the House Mr. that Britain sought no advantage for herself from the offer to lease the New World bases, but he did appeal for “timely reinforcement” of Britain’s navy from the United States—an apparent reference to recent discus-of United States’ aid in filling gaps in the British fleet with over-age destroyers.
A Year of War
Reviewing the year of war just coming to a close, Mr. Churchill found the scales heavier on the side of Britain. He acknowledged that a “cataract of disaster” had poured out during the last three months—the Netherlands and Belgium conquered, France forced out, Italy in the war against Britain, Somaliland gone. But, on the other side, he said, “we have re-armed and re-built our armies in a degree which would have been deemed impossible a few months ago; our navy is far stronger than it was at the beginning of the war; our bomber and fighter strength after all this fighting is larger than it has ever been; our advantages and resources are enormous.” (British casualties in the first year of this war reached 92,000, including civilians, as against 365,000 army and navy losses in the first year of the last war).
Speaking even as three waves of German bombers roared i-cross Britain’s coast, renewing the furious assault of the Nazi air siege, Mr. Churchill let fail enigmatic words: sure
air attacks as long as he has the strength and as long as any preoccupations he may have in re-
History was made last week in a railway car on a remote country siding near Ogdensburg, N.Y., when the Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King, and the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, met for a four-hour conference and came to an agreement which is one of the most momentous ever recorded in the annals of this hemisphere. Mr. King and Mr. Roosevelt discussed the mutual problems of defense in relation to the safety of Canada and the U. S., and, following their meeting, issued a statement outlining the three provisions agreed upon: establishment of a joint U.S.-Can-adain board of defense; this board to “commence immediate studies relating to sea, land and air problems, including personnel and material;” plans for considering the defense of the north-half of the western hemisphere. Thus was cemented the closest bond yet set up between the two great democracies in North America.
Toward Mutual Assistance Pact
The significance of the new agreement was not likely to be realized in its entirety for many a long day. Political observers meantime saw in it an indication that a mutual assistance pact between Canada and in the United States might be in the making; that the Roosevelt administration intended to blanket the Dominion under the protecting folds of the Monroe doctrine; that the armed forces of the two countries might at a future date be unified under one command.

After-harvest cultivation is one of the most practical and most effective methods of controlling weeds, states John D. MacLeod, Crops, Seeds and Weeds Branch, Ont. Dept, of Agriculture. Plants draw heavily on the food stored in the roots in order to produce flower and seed and they are st their weakest stage immediately after the crop has been removed.
For the control of annual and winter annual weeds, shallow, thorough cultivation is mended by using the plow, one-disc, cultivator or disc hay-

row. Seeds are brought near the surface by this plan where they germinate and may be killed by subsequent cultivation. An abundance of. moisture plus the methods outlined above, will destroy millions of seedling plants of such weeds as Stinkwced, Ragweed,
False Flax, Pigweed, Lambs Quarters, Shepherds Purse, etc.
Controlling Perennials
For the control of perennial weeds having deep tap roots, such as Bladder Campion and Chicory, deep plowing is recommended as soon as the crop has been removed, followed by cultivation, using wide, sharp shares which overlap. Thorough, frequent cultivation both ways is essential in order to cut roots and bring them to the surface where the sun will assist in destroying them.

(1)	Practise a green summer fallow when controlling annuals —permit seeds to germinate and destroy them later by cultivation.
(2)	Practise a black summer fallow when fighting winter annuals, biennials and perenniais. Keep the ground absolutely black until frosts will make further cultivation impossible.

"Safe?" Mrs. Archer cried hysterically. “How can you say such a thing when Stanley has been nearly murderedï I shall not feel safe for one minute until we get away from here. I have telegraphed 1 your uncle and Mr. Rradish—”
"Oh, darling? Without even telling me.”
Mrs. Archer flushed guiltily. “And why not?” she demanded with injured dignity. “One might almost think that you were trying to shield this criminal."
"I'LL KEEP MY WORD”

"Oh. I can't stand it any longer! I've been worried to death for weeks, ever since that insolent, lawless man came east and persuaded you to come'back here. He’s at the bottom of all this; I know it.”
"Aunt A dele, please. That isn f

“It’s true, Virginia. And you just keep on, dropping money into this bottomless pit to satisfy the greed of that man, instead of taking the wonderful price Mr. Rradish has offered you just out of friendship and sentiment for the place!”
On and on and on. Accusations, pleas, babbling, hysterical reproaches. Virginia closed her eyes.

Then just before placing your fruit in the jar, rinse with boiling water (be sure you know the trick how to protect your jar). These first steps are the most important to obviate all danger of spoiled fruit. Those of who have filed an article
