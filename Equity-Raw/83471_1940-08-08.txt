But as the zero hour approached, in the war’s forty-fifth week, ft was still a matter of guesswork how Hitler would go about breaking the power of Britain. Would he attempt it through a wholesale invasion of the British Isles? Or would he try to bring the country to its knees by pulverizing it with mass air attacks, *t the same time imposing a starvation blockade by destruction of British shipping?
DOUBLE-HEADER ASSAULT
Would the attack on Britain be eoupled with a simultaneous blow in the Mediterranean? Many experts last week expressed that belief. The Battle of Britain eould not be a simple, straightforward affair. The conflict would have to be divided into two faterlocking phase German assault on England, and the Battle of the Mediterranean
(Mussolinfs affair) HHÉBHH the Axis standpoint, Britain’s hold on the Mediterranean would have io be broken before victory could be achieved.

PUBLICITY FROM HITLER ' An army shake-up took place in the Dominion last week which saw younger men placed in top positions. The new key man of the army in Canada is now Major-General H. D. G Crerar, chief # i the general staff . . . Hen. J. (Î. Gardiner, minister of war services, and Hon. Angus L.‘ Macdonald, minster of national defense for naval services, were both added to the war committee of the Cabinet . . .
Canada achieved public mention in a new quarter last week: Hitler referred to the Dominion in two different passages of his “last-chance-#or peace” speech. s He spoke of British leaders carrying on the war from Canada should Britain itself be conquered by Germany . . .
1

THE ANSWER BRITAIN : Britain’s answer to Hitler’s “last chance” peace proposal came promptly, in the deeds *f British air forces blasting anew at German targets ; in the etaggering new war budget which demanded that Britain give up almost 70 per cent of the national income to finance the war; and In the words of Viscount Halifax, British Foreign Minister, reaffirming the will to fight on.
During the week, the Government announced its formal recognition of the Czecho-Slovak National Committee in headed by former Czech President Dr. Eduard Benes, as the legal government of the German-held nation Churchill told the House of Commons that he did not believe in the exodus of children to Canada and the United States; he thought the movement entirely unwarranted . . . the Admiralty announced the loss of the famous submarine “Salmon” (which sighted the “Çremen” last December) . . . German air attacks iovered practically the whole island, ranging from Scotland to the Chanael and from the North 8ea to the Irish Sea. Aircraft and munitions factories were bombed, railroads and other communications, troop lions, coastal defense works, port facilities . . .
' TO GERMANY VIA SPAIN SPAIN : Britain’s second biggest worry of the week, next to actual invasion, was the Spanish situation. General Franco had finished declaring that it was duty to fulfill the desire of Queen Isabella and return Gibraltar to Spain, and that he had an army of 2,000,000 men ready to back up his contention. It was anticipated that he would make a move against the Rock, aided by German guns across the Bay from Gibraltar ( which had been there since the time of the Spanish Civil War) . . . American citizens returning on the liner “Manhattan” reported German soldiers overrunning Spain.
SPAIN AND THE AXIS By last week everybody knew that Germany was getting oil supplies from the western hemisphere via Spain. The moment appeared to be at hand when Britain would have to clamp down with a blockade through which Spain would be permitted to receive only such imports as are not classified as contraband. Such a move, necessary since British victory depends to a great extent on the ability to prevent Germany from receiving essential supplies from the western world, might draw Spain into the war an the side of the Axis powers.

In Japan, the minister of home affairs in the new Konoye government said: “We cannot doubt that the day soon will come when Japan can share the world with Germany and Itafy.” But otherwise the new regime appeared to be proceeding cautiously in all fields. Prince Konoye in a radio address to the nation declared that the government would assiduously keep open the door for the closest relations with Germany, Italy and Russia but would not close it against any friendly overtures that might be made by the U.

SYNOPSIS
Lee Hollister, returning unexpectedly from a trip abroad to the Circle V ranch, his home from his childhood, Is troubled by signs of neglect. Joey, an old prospector friend of Matt Blair, Lee's foster father and owner of the ranch, tells Lee that Matt has killed himself, probably discouraged by lean times, and the ranch is going to ruin. Virginia, Matt’s daughter, is visiting the Archers, her aunt and uncle in New York. Her uncle wants her to sell the place to Milton Bradish, old associate of Matt’s. Lee persuades Virginia to return to the ranch. Mrs. Archer follows her, accompanied by Stanley, son ton Bradish. Stanley thinks he may be able to discredit Lee in Virgin' la's eyes, and encourages Josefa Ramirez in her liking for Lee.

Amusement was gone now, and a certain grim ness came. He was tired and gloomy; it would be easy tonight to forget a big-brotherly liking and make a little harmless love to Josefa . . . Too easy.

This three-piece outfit has just about all the features you could possibly want in a sports costume. It’s cut for action as well as for tanning. The blouse and shorts can’t separate, for the playsuit is sewed together at the waist. The Button-On Ballerina skirt is cut to fit easily over the shorts. The brief Bolero makes a more formal ensemble out of it, and enables to look suitably dressed at a

SLIM LINES, FURS, PLAINNESS
The general outlines for fall there—slim lines, rich furs and fabrics, an absence of fussy detail. But fashion still needs something to talk about, a shot in the arm for promotional purposes. Something like the hourglass corset or the up-hair do of other seasons.
Out of last spring’s fashion trends, two seem likely to carry into fall—the : .annish trend and the South American trend.
AZTEC PRINTS
The mannish trend will be felt in college girl clothes—suits and sport things. Smith and Vassar started it by buying jackets in men’s wear shops. Style scouts took notice, and this fall every college shop will offer boyish sack suits made up in masculinelooking tweeds.
The South American trend was strong early in the spring, faded for a while, and now is strong again. There are likely to be more and more tambourine hats, black lace shawls, sombreros, Aztec prints.

Josefa s eyes had scarcely left his face. Once they drifted swiftly beyond him, but he did not see.

With a final whirl she flung herself backwards, throwing her lithe young body out of balance.

Soldier’s blue woollen is featured for a one-piece dress with narrow waistband, gold buttons. The buttons are worked in double file in the skirt —a treatment that is being much used for fall.
A three-piece suit, features the long-fitted jacket that buttons up to high club collar and has four patch pockets. The topcoat is a boxy one, the tweed fabric a blend of wools, said to feature camel hair.
As a college girl feature, the long Bahama shirt is much favored. It is a man's type of shirt-jacket of about knuckle-length, boxy and casual. It comes in flannel with contrasting flannel skirt. Simply tailored flannel jacket suits are highlighted too.

Pleats are nicely worked in groups to give fullness without much flare. A shirred tunnel for the belt is smartly used on one casual jersey dress with big pockets. Plain wool jerseys, corduroy with jersey, cashmere blend jersey, ibbbmbbbbhhbi wool mixtures are accented.

home is at your service.”
A long-forgotten manuscript identified by the Bodleian Library, Oxford, England, proves that Mother Hubbard, of nursery-rhyme fame, really did exist. Miss May Stubbington came across the original manuscript of the famous nursery rhyme while going over some old family papers. It was written in 1804 by Miss Sarah Martin, daughter of Sir Henry Martin, of Lockynge. So the rhyme, which is world-famous and thought by many to be centuries old is quite young. The inspiration of it was Mother Hubbard, housekeeper to the famous old j West Country family of Bastard !	—whose present representative is
¦ Colonel Reginald Bastard, of Kit-ley, Devon. She had a dog she fond of, and had gone to find j it a bone when Miss Martin arrived. So the dog’s unhappy dilemma was handed down to history !
.	When your light-colored leather
gloves show signs of grubbiness, put them on and rub gently with a perfectly clean cloth dipped in a white shoe cream. Look after your husband's felt hat; slight surface spots can be removed easily aud at once by rubbing gently with fine sandpaper. If baby's pram or cot blanket gets worn, cut out funny animals from colored wool material or from felt, and applique them over the worn parts; baby will bless you and the blanket will last longer and look smart.
Never throw away orange peel; dry it In the oven, put into a net bag and hang it In the wardrobe to keep moths away. When stewing fruit, add a few dates stoned and cut up, and stew them along with the fruit; use only two-thirds the normal amount of sugar for sweetening the fruit then. Look around you, you country readers, aud help yourself to nature’s vegetables. Young stinging nettles (pick them in leather gloves, mind!) cooked like spinach and served with a | dollop of butter on top, will fool the ; family completely and will Improve their complexions at the same time.
How about ice cream and cantaloupe for a porch supper during hot weather? Make it something special — cantaloupe a la mode, garnished with fresh peaches and blackberries for good measure.
The vanilla ice cream for which we are giving you the recipe is going to be one of the easiest, nicest and most economical you have ever made. Not too rich, but smooth and full-bodied. Made with only one part cream to three parts milk, which is one-third to one-sixth as much as most recipes call for — a feature that will delight your household budget and prove a boon to those of your family who love Ice cream but And it too fattening. And using no eggs, so you can guess how simple it is. All this because It Is a rennet-custard ice cream, and rennet has a way with milk, as you rennet-custard fans already know.

“I have named three persons to investigate similar organizations in other provinces”, he said. “I do not think, personally, that it would be possible for us to copy Ottawa’s Commission. I believe we should first have an organism charged with having prospective civil servants pass their examinations.
We will, naturally, await the results of our present survey before taking any decision in the matter. But 1 feel I can say that by the time the next Legislature session rolls around we should be inf a position to provide for creation of Civil Service Commission for this province.”

generous use of vegetables will provide plenty of vitamin B in the diet. Some leafy vegetables such as raw cabbage and r^w spinach, tomatoes, root vegetables, especially rutabaga, carrots, and onions, rank high as sources of vitamin C. Spinach, asparagus, and green beans contain an abundance of vitamin G.
The cooking of vegetables affects their taste, appearance, and food value. Whether or not the family will enjoy and eat cooked vegetables depends upon the knowledge and skill of the person preparing them. Vegetables are at their best when cooked only until tender and served as quickly as possible after cooking. Since high temperatures may destroy vitamins, vegetables should not be overcooked.

The views expressed by Der Nord westen from week to week do not ex aggerate the seriousness of the situation that confronts us. We believe our read-understand that, for our attitude has been generally commended.
It would be much more pleasant it could say that we are safe on this side of the Atlantic from the terror which is, day and night, sweeping over the British Isles But we are not—and though we should escape the physical dangers, what would it profit us, if we were subjected instead ?
We are keenly appreciative of the difficulties that the tragedy forced upon us, brings to loyal German Canadians. Many of them still have close ties of kinship with their Fatherland and the sentiments which arise from that fact not readily eradicated, nor should they be under less dangerous circumstances. This, however* is the day of stern realism. All those who love Canada must put Canada first, and must act with all the force of which they are capable, remembering that the War is not of Canada’s creation, not of Britain’s creation, but was conceived and plotted iu the chancelleries of Germany and Italy, with the dominating object of crushing all nations that would not bow the knee to the Dicta tors views of civilization challenge which Dominions (with their own absolute of self-government) accepted the War which, with CanadaV foelp in man power, supplies and un daunted courage, must be won if all that is worth living for is not to vanish from this land which we cheerfully
accepted as our home.

Their father, Reginald Mclnnis, an apartment-house doorman, said that while Margie seems to do better in school, Florrie is more full of pep and more carefree. > Mrs. Mclnnis agreed that Margie seems to learn more readily in school, but said that “Florrie figures out a way that she is going to be better than the other ones.” The girls still go to see Dr. McGraw once a week, but Dr. McGraw says that she was “not allowed” to discuss the results of her

Saving Ontario’s Natural Resources






LESSON V THE TWO WAYS —
Matthew 7:24-27
Golden Text: "For Jehovah know* eth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.” Ps. 1:1.
THE LESSON IN ITS SETTING Time — While we do not know when the First Psalm was written, the words quoted Cjom Matthew were spoken in the spring of A.D.

Psalm 1;
!} This Curious World

By G. C. TONER
By William Ferguson
(No. 1)
Talk of the conservation of our natural resources lias become fashionable of late years. Few people, however, seem to understand the true meaning of such conservation. Many think it means that we should keep our wild life, our forests, our fishes, undisturbed and unutilized.
with the natural increase locked away from the people. Others believe that some portion of these resources should be harvested but fail to take account of the complications that arise when nature becomes unbalanced. A few look forward. believing our resources can yield much if harvested properly under scientific management.
Conservation of natural resources means the wise use of everything that grows or lives upon the land. It means the maintenance of our soil and water. It means that our natural products must be utilized in such a way that an ample surplus is left for seed or breeding stock. It means that the harvesting must not spoil the environment. These would seem to be common-sense rules, easily applied. Actually, they are disregarded and the result is depletion.
THE NEW VIEWPOINT
The changes that have taken place in the lumbering industry illustrate the new viewpoint, old method was to go into the woods and make a clear sweep, taking everything merchantable and leaving the debris lying where it fell. Far too often this debris has caught fire and when this happened it took several years for even berry bushes to cover the scar. In some cases it required generations before desirable timber covered the countryside again. Often this fire destroyed the humus of the soil and rains soon washed away the fertile upper layers. The bedrock is near the surface, over much of Ontario, where fire left a barren desert without soil.
The modern way of lumbering is largely selective. Only the desirable mature trees are cut, the remainder carefully protected so that another crop will come on quickly. The debris is handled in such a way that there is no great fire menace of tinder-dry brush in drought periods. The wild creatures are.not unduly disturbed and the soil is left intact. Enough young trees are left to hold the snow and the rain so that the underground water table is not lowered. All the work is planned to keep the forests on a sustained yield, managed as a crop rather than like a mine.

Place — No one is able to identify the place in which the First Psalm was written; neither are we quite sure where the mountain was located on which Christ delivered this great Sermon, though it is generally understood to be in Judaea.
In this lesson we perceive life is never a failure unless there is a cause for that failure, whether it be In one’s own conduct and character, or in outside circumstances, does not want men to fail in life, to come to disaster, and the verses which we study in this lesson are divine instructions from our heavenly Father telling us how to live so that life may be all that we want it to be and all that God desires it to be.

A GODLY MAN
Ps. 1:1: Blessed Is the man. By the term “blessedness’' we understand the highest good for man regarded as a gift from God, or as enjoyed in some divine relationship. Throughout the Bible this is centred in the idea of life. From the great spiritual passages in the Old Testament we conclude that.God’s desire is for every man to be truly blessed, to be satisfied with life; and that God continually Instructs man how this blessed life may be obtained, hi this psalm the negative aspects of such a life of blessedness precede the positive. That walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth In the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers. 2. But his delight is In the law of Jehovah; and on his law doth he meditate day and night. The secret of deliverance from a life of wickedness is to be fully occupied with the things of righteousness. How can one know what the way of the Lord is? By studying the word of God, meditating upon It, testing one’s life by it.
HE SHALL PROSPER 3. And he shall be like a tree that Is planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper. The life of the godly man is maintained by the supplies of grace drawn from constant communion with God through his revelation. The law of the Lord Is at once soil and stream. In the one aspect fastening a life to It gives stability; in the other, freshening and means of growth. The psalm anticipates Christ's teaching of the good tree bringing forth good fruit, and also tells how his precept of making the tree good Is to be obeyed — namely, by transplanting it from the soil of self-will to that of delight in the law. The last clause of verse 3 must not be taken as a promise of wealth for every one who lives according to the word of God, but a promise of success in whatever such a man undertakes. The man of God is a sane man, a strong man, a man whom men will honor and trust and reward in the things of this life.
AN UNGODLY MAN 4. The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driv-efch away. Compare Ps. 35:6, Job 21:18, Isa., 17:13; Hos. 13:3). The scattering of chaff by the wind is a common figure in the Old Testament for the sudden destruction of the wicked. Here it describes their character as well as their fate. 5. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment (the wicked shall not be able to keep his feet in a time of Judgement). Nor sinners In the congregation of the righteous.

forth in a parable of the tree, our Lord here sets forth, even more vividly, in a parable of building houses. Every man builds. But notice the difference. It is not In the men who build; or in the materials with which they bull#; but in the foundation upon which they build. The foundation is everything. Hear then, the imperial claim of Christ.

Farmers Should Save Themselves
Only the farmers themselves can save Canadian agriculture as an industry, speakers declared at a recent meeting of all York County farm organizations In Newmarket as a York County branch of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture was formed.
“If we leave everything to government boards we will be burdened with a bureaucracy we don't want,” said H. H. Hannam, secretary of the United Farmers of Ont-, ario. He said the Federation now has 300,000 members across the country.
Mr. Hannam cited figures to show that average farm income had fallen from $1,000 in 1926 to $400 In 1930 and predicted disaster to the

Watch Sunburn

IT

The Burma Road, which Great Britain has agreed to close to halt a flow of war supplies to the Chinese Central Government, is a highway which might have been conceived by a Hollywood director and executed by the Pharahos of ancient Egypt.
It is a vital part of the 2,000-mile long trade route from Burma’s seaport of Rangoon to the Yangtse river, connecting the Burmese railroad at Lashio with Kunming (formerly called Yunnanfu),
the capital of Yunnnan Province.
Work on the most difficult stretch of the great new road, between the Burma border and Kunming, was not started until the fall of 1937, when military exigencies caused the British authorities to cut through a freight route to British Asia to ship products to regions cut off by the Japanese occupation of Pacific ports.
The Hollywood setting is provided by sparsely settled regions of snowcapped mountains and ricebordered plateau lakes, tropical jungles of bamboo and teak-wood, and forests of towering evergreens where bands of gibbons scream in the shadows and strange birds chatter and sing.
The suggestion of ancient Egyptian methods of construction is inescapable. Most of the construction was done by hand by thousands of men, women and children with only a few crude tools.

The Health League advises that tan is becoming, but it should be acquired gradually. Sun-baths also should not exceed ten minutes for the first time. An additional five minutes might be added to subsequent sunnlngs.
Long and unaccustomed exposure to hot sun rays is likely to result in severe burns,, and these may be as deep and dangerous as burns received in other ways.

At the camera is Fred Young, chief cameraman of the Oxtus film production “Forty-Ninth Parallel” now in the making at Banff, Lake O’Hara and Montreal. Stars of the picture arc Raymond Massey, Elizabeth Bcrgner, and Leslie Howard, but to his friends and most C.P.R. folk in the west Smoky Shaw is the real one. He has been loaned i© the film company at the request of the director, Michael Powell, for the shooting of all the railroad sequences. Smoky now resides at Medi-cfaic Hat,'Alta.	—C.P.R. Photo.

Many of Canada's valuable furbearing animals are subject to a marked fluctuation In numbers, according to the Department of Mines and Resources which, with the assistance of the Bureau of Animal Population, Oxford University, and tha Hudson’s Bay Company, is making a study of wild life populations.
This survey takes the form of an annual questionnaire distributed to resident traders, trappers, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and officers of government departments stationed in She Northwest Territories. The Investigation is carried on from year to year because the situation is changing continually and it Is hoped that the work will produce data from which a forecast can be made relating to the expected abundance of each important species.
The results of the study may also suggest measures to prevent unnecessary depletion of any species of wild life during the periods of scarcity.

CAN SPOT CAMOUFLAGE
Prof. George B. Riggs, last week peered through his green eyeshade visor. Green trees and plants appeared red. But when he gazed ont through the same green vizor at a green-painted bench or fence, they retained their natural appearance.
So, Prof. Riggs disclosed, he believes he stumbled onto the basic principle of a goggle which might permit aerial observers to spot camouflaged gun emplacements.
Prof. Riggs, botanist at the University of Washington oceanographic laboratories, said he believed the distinction between natural and green-painted objects was due to the chlorophyll (green coloring material in growing plants) giving off a reddish florescence when viewed throuh the special goggle lens.

Letellier said the increases were due to Federal surtax increase of war insurance rates, and in some cases, higher manufacturing costs. The rise goes in to effect immediately.
It amounts to 10 per cent, on wines, and from 10 to 25 cents a bottle on Scotch whisky, cognacs and brandies, according to their quality.
The increase in prices of imported wines and liquors has been in effect in Hull since July 1st, according to officials in the Hull liquor stores.
