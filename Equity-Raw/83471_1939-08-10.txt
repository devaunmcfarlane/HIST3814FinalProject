Preparation: All fruit should be picked carefully and then prepared according to type. Large frette should be cut la pieces and If dry and pulpy such as apples and pears should be covered with water be fore simmering until tender. Small Juicy fruits require no water.
Open Kettle Canning: If fruit la moderately acid and very Juicy usa no water but cover with sugar and let stand over night. In the morning cook until tender wljh as little stirring as possible. Fruits less Juicy should be covered with a sugar syrup and cooked until tender

CHAPTER I
it was a week alter her father's funeral. Claire Fosdtck stood In the luxuriously furnished library and looked about her with a shudder. Almost as though she half expected some menacing horror to reach out from the Tamiliar shadows and clutch her. Then she jerked herself together with an effort. Over there, by his favorite lamp, his body had been found, slumped forward in an unnatural twisted position could see It yet, though she had tried to forget. Fearfully she looked there now, and was conscious of a feeling of relief when only the outlines of the cushions of the big wing chair and the curve of the table met her gaze.
The death certificate had said heart trouble, and there had been no autopsy. Nick Baum had managed that for her. But always in the back of Claire's mind would be the question ó why had her father died so unexpectedly? seemed as well as usual when she bade him goodnight and left him chatting with Nick. And Nick had said that when he left at 11 o'clock Mr. Fosdtck walked to the door with him and seemed in the best of spirits. Yet he w a# gone and now Claire was alone with the wreck of the family fortune. This city house and the mountain property were about all that was left, and she knew only too well that Nick Baum had claims on both words came back to her.
ìWe must pay Nick by this time next month. Daughter."
ìBut, daddy," she had exclaimed. "Surely Nick will "
ìYou don't understand Nick has been more than lenient.
I couldn't ask him to extend the time again. We've got to find the money somehow."
But how? Wearily Claire inventoried again her chances of supplying a large sum of money in a limited space of time. Trained for nothing but a society life, lacking the money that seemed as far distant as the snow capped mountain peaks ó what could she do?
As though In answer to her problem. the door behind her opened and a tall young man came eagerly toward her and took both her cold hands in his.
ìNick! 1	ó 1 didn't know you
were here. I didn't hear you come
could have goue through everything without you, butó"
She jarred back against a small table, dashing a delicate Dreed*Æ figure to the floor. It lay shattered lute bits. She gated down at It In a dated maimer. It was like her own world always beeu so beautiful and safe. Smashed Into broken pieces.
ìBut what, Claire?" he persisted. ìYou know Iím crazy about you and want you to marry me. Why won't you say you will? You're the loveliest girl Iíve ever known ó and the coldest. Can't you like me a little. dearest?"
Claire looked regretfully at him. Certainly he seemed everything a girl could desire, as he stood there pleading with her. Handsome, and young and ardent. Yes. she was a fool, yetó
"I do like you a lot. Nick." Her voice was sincere. "1 like you but ó oh, donít ask me now. 1 donít know ó Iím ó Iím so uncertain about everything. Iím going up to the mountain house for a few days. Maybe when I come back ó maybe later, Nick, dear ó please
With a choked sob she turned and ran out into the ball and upstairs to her own room. Crumpling in a heap before her small dressing table she pressed her small, clenched fists to her cheeks. ì1 can't ó 1 just can't! I must find some other way out." The words ended In t ea rs.

Queenís Jewels Influence Mode
<

' Weíve never been sure. Hannah. You know Uncle had some wonderful stones. He was an authority on such things and bought them all over the world on his various travels. But he was always boasting to everyone about his Jewel of the Rockies,* as he called It. He spoke of It again as he lay dying. Said It was hidden In the house, and that we must never let the place go out of our possession. But after we looked and looked without finding anything, we weren't sure whether It was Just a fancy or not. You know Uncle was dreadfully eccentric."

Claire pulled on a pair of driving gloves taught me yourself never to be afraid of anything. Besides, what on earth could happen in such a peaceful old place as the mountain house? It's an event If even a peddler finds his way up there from the village." She dropped a light kiss on Hannah's nose, and without waiting for any more objections she went downstairs.
Remember you

But it was the pride of Uncle Lyman's heart, Hannah. He spent a small fortune copying the eastern mansions he'd known. He thought nothing was too grand to build in his beloved mountains. That house and his Jewels were the passions of his life."
ìYep. the Fosdlcks always were up in the air about some fool thing. Your Uncle Lyman was the worst o' the mess, but even your own father was a dreamer. Rest his soul. Lucky for you that your mother was a real westeru woman with her feet on Ií 9 ground and her head full of horse sense. Or you might be goiní íround, too, with your Ideas In the clouds.

ìClaire, honey!" An elderly maidís startled face appeared around an open closet door. She hurried to the girl and put tier arms about her. every Inch of her rugged gaunt ness bristling with a maternal protectiveness.
ìTell Hannah all about It now, child." She smoothed Claireís very rumpled curls as she had gone in the years before when she was a nurse to the motherless little girl. ìAnyone been pesteriní you?" She poked her cap to a belligerent angle. her seamed and weather-beaten face glaring defiance.
Claire laughed shakily. Drawing Hannah's head down, she kissed her. ìDon't frown so fiercely, old dear. Anyone would think you were still fighting Apaches out on your ranch in the early days. Some scrapper yet, aren't you?" Claire got up and dabbed at her eyes.
Jewel of the Rockies
Hannah nodded. "You said it, honey. 1 am when anyone goes try-in* to drop a loop over you If you ain't willin'. Go on now, tell me. Is it that Baum fellah again?"
"Yes." Clair answered slowly. ìHe's awfully nice and he loves me
All things whatsover ye would that men should do to you. do ye even so to them.óChristian,
Here She Could Live . . .
As she passed the library she halted a minute and softly closed the door which was haf open. She had been pretty hard on Nick. And he had done so much. Why couldn't she love him as she had always hoped She would love the man she married?
She let herself out into the garden and hurried to the garage. And here she got her own little car and soon was threading her way right through the traffic of the city, headed for the road that ran along straight as an arrow toward the mountains.
The way was too familiar to make the trip at night seem an undertaking. Hadnít she driven It more times than she could remember when she and her father had gone to the House of Long Shadows to spend the week-end? settled down to a steady pace that would bring her to her destination long before midnight.
After half an hour the houses began to thin out and small dry farms took the place of suburbs. The cool evening air of the open country blew against her cheeks. As always, a tingle of anticipation ran through her when she entered the foothills, with the high peaks hunched dimly behind them.
The mountains invariably held that attraction for Claire, no matter how familiar she was with them. For her, nothing could ever take the place of their changing moods. All the mad, colorful life of the hardy seekers for gold, their tragedies and romances, successes and failures, seemed embodied in the towering snow capped crags that jagged against the skyline.
That was why going to the old house in the mountains had always been an adventure to the girl.. The House of Long Shadows the very name her uncle had given his home made it a house of dreams Here she could live again. In Imagination the exciting days when the little mining town nearby had been a blaze of hectic life. When fortunes were won or lost In a night and the haunting quest of gold turned the heads of the steadiest of men.
A Sudden Grinding Crash
Now the road began to wind very sharply, coiling about the rugged side of the mountain. Higher and higher went the car, each succeeding loop in the road lifting It above the plains below. Soon the city became a miniature twinkling fairyland, Its streets outlined In rows of tiny points of light tired of this picture. She threw back her head and filled her lungs with the bracing air, a sense of exhilaration sweeping through her.
Unconsciously she pressed on the accelerator. The car leaped forward with a sudden spurt of speed that sent the gravel flying down the steep fide of the mountain. Instantly Inejeried b: k from the danger j of taking the curves t o fast. She knew oolj

GERMANY
We bear much of what Hitler bis 'ëdone for Germany/' We bear less of what be bai done to Germany . . . to German human beings.
Wbat he hue done to German hu man beings is disclosed In part by an analysis wblcb the New York Times has made of German vital statistics. Thus:
t ince Hitler came to power in JCZ3 cases of diphtheria and scarlet fever have virtually doubled; of rp nal meningitis actually trebled. Food poisoning cases increased from 1,665 In 1933 to 3,764 in 1937. Death rates between the ages of one and five went up 12.5 per cent, for girls and 20 per cent, for boys between 1932 and 1936.

8KEET AND TRAP SHOOTING
The ten zone winners In the Dominion Marksmenn 1939 national ikeet and trap shooting championships, who emerged victorious over some 400 of the countryís leading clay-pigeon marksmen competing on 30 skeet teams and 24 trap ïquads, were announced recently from the headquarters of the Dominion Marksmen headquarters in Montreal.
The first renewal of the Dominion. Marksmen national shooting championships, this yearís shooting tournament will give some 3,000 skeet marksmen throughout Canada their second championship team since the sport was introduced to this country at St. Stephen, N.B., in 1929. For trap shooters the competition marks only the second time that a national trap title has been at stake since Jack Trotter, old-time Winnipeg marksman, Invented the clay-pigeon more than 60 years ago.
Dominion Skeet Champlonahlp
Defending the Canadian Skeet Championship In the Dominion finals held at the end of July la tha York Skeet Club team from Toronto. This team posted the highest score among the skeet zone finalists. The Toronto team scored 236 out of a possible 260 points to successfully defend Its Central Zone title against six other entries representing Hamilton, Copper Cliff# London, Levack and Toronto. The other skeet zone winners were: St. John Skeet Club, Montreal Skeet Club, Medicine Hat Gun Club and Trail, B.C., Trap and Skeet Club.
Dominion Trap Shooting Championships
In the trap shooting championships, the defending national title-holders from the Saskatoon Gun Club successfully defended their Mid-Western Zone title after a very thrilling shoot off against a crack five-man squad from the Medicine Hat Gun Club. The two teams tied In the regular zone shoot with a score of 243 out of a possible 250.
In the shoot-off the Saskatoon men outshot their rivals by a single point atfer posting a score of 242 out of 250. The Medicine Hat team fell to second place among the other three entries from Calgary, Edmonton and Saskatoon who represented the 26 registered clubs In the Mid-Western Zone. The other four trap zone winners were: Dartmouth,. N.S., Rod and Gun Club, Grand Trunk Riverside Gun Club of Montreal, Sun-nlngdale Gun Club of London, Ont. and the Vancouver Gun Club.


BRITAINíS CANNY MOVE: When Britain decided to extend credits totalling $300,000,000 to her potential allies for the purchase of munitions and other war materials she made a canny move. More potent than threats of force Is the threat of economic resistance to fascist plana of conquest. While relative military strength has been debat-England and France are unbeatable In the field of financeó and Hitler knows it. Thufi th . more Important result of the British decision Is Its moral effectófor British credits are more convincing evidence of future Intention* than British promises.
Itís a common enough Impulse to fling protection to the winds, or whatever winds blew before the sunshine came along, but that doesn't do away with the common-sense fact that your eyes need it, your head needs It, and most certainly your beauty needs it.
First, letís be sensible about your eyes, and mix the sense with fun.
Gone are the days when dark glasses were either a sign of defective sight or an attempt at disguise.
Today, on a sunny day, they are Indispensable as lipstick, and even more useful. An afternoonís sunbath, without glasses, can undo all the good that i yearís care ever did. An hourís squinting Into the sun can produce a finer crop of wrinkles than a decade of time.

To most of us Bastille Day his much more significance than Just aa National holiday. To Frenchmen and to the rest of the world It Is a memorial to the ìprinciples of 1776 and 1789 % to ideas common to Western democracy, think of the storming of the Bastille wo realize that It was an act of defiance against vested authority, a dramatic and concrete assertion that men can and will overthrow a government with which they are dissatisfied.

BUMMER READING
When the mercury rises and our brows bead with the heat of summer we turn to the more amusing In the realms cf literature. For summer reading we find that the shorter stories and human anecdotes of some of the popular essayists are delightful.
Among the favorites we have selected three to recommend. One is that little masterpiece from the pen of Cornelia Otis Skinner, ìExcuse It Please,î In which the author carries you along through a aeries of her amusing experiences, such as meeting old school friends and not having one thing In common with them, and learning to ride a horse.
One of the best collections which has not received the attention It deserves Is Harold Nicholson's ìSmall Talk.î Many are familiar, with the Hon. Harold Nicholson, M.P., in ìPunchî magazine but they should be more familiar with these witty essays. ìSmall Talk" Is a tonic!
The third to come to mind at this season Is one that is listed among the new books. Dorothy Parker, favorite of many has released a new collection of her short stories entitled, ìHere Lie#.î Mrs. Parker in all her works shows perfectly, certain situations common to the lives of millions of human beings of all classes, races and nationalities. Her wit Is at times barbed and again she writes with compassion but at all times she la penetrating.
We guarantee that one or all three of these will prove entertaining and will leave the reader chuckling and refreshed.

Whereas to date no Province in Canada has successfully operated Provincial Parks.
Whereas Quebec now have three Parks, Mont Tremblant Park, Oxford Park and Laurentide Park. No development of any account has ever been made in these Parks and there is nothing in the way of immediate prospects of any improve ment being made. None of these Parks compare in any way with the facilities that areoffeied by the many National Parks of Canada, and what facilities they do offer are beyond the reach of the average citizen in the matter of charges for the privileges offered.
Whereas having contributed for many years towards the Parks developed by the Federal Government, it is only fair that the poople of Quebec should be entitled to a National Park in their

A fine new ìland ship" headquarters, the "Valiant,î constructed by Sarnia Sea Scouts of two old boxcars secured from the Canadian National Railways, was "launchedî by a banquet to sponsoring members of the Sarnia Yacht Club. The banquet was served aboard "Valiantî by Sea Scout "sea cooks.î
Furnishings of the S.S.S. "Vsli antî include the shipís bell of the old ferryboat ìPappoose,î which operated between Windsor and Detroit in 1872. On the fireplace mantel is a model lighthouse, with realistic "winkerî light, placed there as a memorial to the late Dr. A. G Campbell, for a number of years skipper of the Sarnia Rover Sea Scouts. Another prized possession, within a glass frame above the fireplace, is an ensign that flew on H.M.S. ìValiantî at the battle of Jutland, in which ship Sea Scoutmaster Charles Gray served as a signaller.

Zinnias Quick To Germinate For Fall Bloom
Riot of Color For F'Jtil

%

Although this picture was not made while the British planes were flying over France, it was snapped for the express purpose of showing the planes and formations used. The planes are Wellington bombers of the very latest issue. On July 14th, during the French national celebrations, five squadrons of these bombers and lighters, flew to the southwest of France and back, on normal training flights. Inasmuch as the distance was the same as it would be to leading industrial centres o f Germany, the parade of Englandís air might became an impressive factor in the present European game of ìpow er politics.î The flights were concluded without the ïlightest mishap.
The zinnia ha* traveled far since grandmotherís day when It waa known aa "youth and o!d age," a title bestowed upon ZlnnU elegant, the common species from which most of our garden limitas were derived. Its development lu color and form has been so ra; a! In the last ten years as to outiaiª most horticultural works on the subject. Many seed houses today Iht the zinnia as the beet selling garden flower seed, with petunias Igolds following close be!

A Few Suggestions To Add To Our Comfort When Mercury Hits High

Across Europe

The Bduube, destined for increasing importance as part of a new 2,400 mile waterway across Europe, was brought into the news again by the recent meeting between the Foreign ministers of Rumania and Yugoslavia, on a barge In the stream.

QUANTITIES OF VITAMIN K In one of the greatest scientific feats ever recorded, four groups of chemists working independently, reported simultaneously the syneth-sla of vitamin K, the new vitamin that stops inernal bleeding.
This means thousands of lives will be saved annually, for the synthesis makes the vitamin, which has been difficult to extract from natural substances, available in unlimited quantities.
The vitamin previously was extracted from alfalfa. The chemists made it from coal tar. The artificial vitamin has four times the potency of natural vitamin K. Hardly ever is a synthetic chemical so much better than the natural one.
íFLU CLUE FOUND An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced recently that medical science is near success In its great search for the origin of great human influents epidemics search, the Journal stated, has led to hogs and earthworms.
The journalís editorial told of research
done by Dr. R. B. Shope, of Rockefeller Institute. Dr. Shope# observations were so astounding that, If they are confirmed, much of the medical literature on virus diseases such aa poliomyelitis or Infantile paralysis "will have to he rewritten,î the journal said.
ROLE OF WORM Dr. Shope concluded that worms were "carriersî of swine influenza virus. He found that earthworms swallow the egg of swine lungworms, that the larvae of these parasites develop In the earthworm and re-enter hogs when they eat earthworms.
This suggested the possibility of a transformation of the virus In the lungworms or a complex life cycle In the earthworm, which the medical Journal indicated might throw new light on the whole subject of virus diseases.
"Lungworm larvae from pigs with swine Influenza harbor swine Influenza virus throughout their development,1" Dr. Shope reported. He said the virus apparently lies latent much of the time. ï
"Whether the swine influenza la an abberant type of the human influenza Is still controversial," the Journal commented.
Civility costs nothing; it might even be a good investment later en, and is a good insurance.
This type of insurance was carried rather far by a man who always made a low obeisance when-evei our Lordís name or Satan was mentioned during the church ser-]jte. A new minister, struck by the oddity of this and anxious to correct him, inquired after the service why he bowed when the devil was mentioned. He immediately replied: "Well, ye see, 1 be very, very old, and civility costs ucthing,î and after a pause, "and ye never know.î
Now that the hot weather Is here at last, It might be well for us to heed a few of the suggestions which the National Safety Council baa issued for the care of our health during the torrid weather:
Keep your body clean by frequent bathing.
Wear light and loose clothing.
Do not overeat, but do eat more vegetables and less meat.
Drink lemonade, orangeade and other citrus fruit drinks.
Keep your elimination habits regular.
Do not use strong alcoholic drinks.	*
Get plenty of sleep and reel; avoid over-fatigue.
Cool water Is best for drinking. If a little table salt Is added, in the proportion of one level teaspoon of salt to one gallon of water, It will assist in bodily elimination, and will replace the normal salts lost In perspiration.
An appeal to the Boy Scouts of the United States to help clean up ìthe real public enemies, the corrupt politicians,î who he said were responsible or the army of nearly 5,0b0,000 criminals in the country, was made by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, before a great gathering of Scouts at the New York Worldís Fair. ìEvery boy you teach to hate crime,î he maid, ìis a victory for our side. Keep it clear in your minds that good politics is a great and beneficial thing, But that corrupt politics is a criminal thing. There should be nothing but scorn disgrace for anyone who betrays this greatest of vocations.î
New German Canal This mighty highway of commerce from Southern Germany aero** the Balkans to the Black Sea also forms parts of three international boundaries, between Slovakia and Hungary, Yugoslavia and Rumania, and the latter country and Bulgaria, a bulletin of the National Geograpbis Magazine recalls. Germany Is constructing a canal which will connect the upper Danube and the Main River in Bavaria, which jn turn flows Into the Rhine. Canal Will Link North Sea and
Black Sea
"Completion of the new waterway, scheduled for 1945, will make possible the shipment of goods by water, without transfer, all the way across Europe, from the North Sea at the mouth of the Rhine to the Black Sea at the mouth of the Danube.î the bulletin continues.

The doom of the false prophets, the life of Elijah, the future of Israel, and the honor of God are all involved in what should happen following Elijah's prayer. This miraculous and supernatural fire falling from the heaven convinced the people that Jehovah was the true God.
39. And when all the people saw It, they fell on their faces; and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he if God.
Thus the greet fire was the emblem of Jehovah, and the sign of his acceptance of his people's service. And so priests of Baal put to death, not so much from revenge as queen Jezebel had murdered the prophets of the true God, but to carry out the fundamental law of the Old Testament kingdom of God, which prohibted idolatry on pain of death.
40-46: When the last priest of Baal had been put to death Elijah turned to the king and told him t# go up to his house and eat and drink for an abundance of rain would soon fall upon the fearfully parched land. But the prophet himself went up to Mount Carmel and cast himself down upon the earth and "put his face between his knees." Thus a solitary man brought back rain to Israel. His prayer was abundantly answered.
There are certain characteristics in Elijahís prayer, which should form the part of all true prayer. It was based on the promise of God. It was definite. It was earnest, humble and full of expectant faith.

Elijahís Prayer
,And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that 1 have done all these things at thy word.

Lesson
31-37: And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood.
Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.
And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. A

THE LESSON IN ITS SETTING
Time.óThe exact year when these events took place we cannot determine; the late Dr. Willis J. Beecher suggests the year 909 or 908 B.C., and this is near enough.
Place.óMount Carmel is that great mountain range midway along* the Mediterranean shor of Palestine and Syria, * rising from the. western side of the plain of E&draelon. The river Kishon flows past the northern base of Mount Carmel, emptying into the Mediterranean near the city of Haifa.
1-30: And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.
Without a word of previous information regarding Elijah, we are simply told that ìElijah the Tiehbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.î Ahab, King of Israel, was married to one of the most Ticked women of hia-tory, Jezebel; She had brought every abomination and idolatrous practice from her native home in Syria along with all the priests of

Peppermint It Product
Of Pacific Northwest
Most of us like the flavor of peppermint in candies, gum, toothpaste, soft drinks, ice cream and other delicacies. This pleasant, aromatic oil also helps to make some of our medicines more palatable, and has a wide variety of other commercial uses.
Peppermint, known botanically as mentha Piperta, has been grown In the Pacific Northwest for about 2* years, says the Washington Farmer There are now about 3,500 acres of mint under cultivation in this area Good mint produces 40 to 80 pounds of oil per acre and in 1938 it sold for about $1.75 a pound.
Wild mint is found in many moist spots and lowland areas, but it is of no commercial value, as the oil yield is small and of low quality.
Mint requires low, well-watered muck lands, or irrigated soils. Harvest generally comes in August. Mint land should be summe&fal* lowed. The plants are started from selected runners, which may be plowed out from an oil field and transplanted, end to end in rows about 3Ik feet apart. The cost of runners to set a crop is around $15 an acre. Young plants can also be set one foot apart in May or early June. Constant cultivation is required. After the mint is up about six inches it must be weeded several times by hand, as weeds and grass in the hay will discolor and lint the oil.

Lignin From Corn Cobs Softens Hard City Water
AMES, IOWA.óIn their searcl for some practical use for lignin one of the countryís principal waste products, federal chemists have dis covered that recovered lignin is more effective in treating hard water containing iron than commercial compounds now in use.
At the agricultural by-products laboratory in Ames, chemists of the department of agriculture treated hard city water, hard well water, and water containing added ' iron with lignin prepared from com cobs and found this material to be effective as an iron-removal agent
Supplies of lignin are inexpensive because they are almost limitless Roughly, one-fourth of all wood plants, including trees, is lignin. As a waste product of wood pulp mills, where its disposal pollutes streams, it amounts to about 1,500,000 dry-weight-tons each year.
6,000,000 tons a year is available from corn stalks and an equal quantity from wheat straw. Other extensive supplies are cottonseed hulls and sugarcane bagasseóthe fiber remaining after the juice has been squeezed from it.	,
The discovery promises the firsrt extensive use for lignin in its original form, because few cities have water sufficiently pure that it does , not require treatment for removing iron, which imparts an unsightly ap-oearance and undesirable taste.

Poor Policy to Have Hoorn Run Loose

It is poor economy to let hens range for themselves. Nutritional authorities of the Dominion Department of Agriculture claim that where hens are not given any cereals or prepared feeds, Grade A eggs can hardly he expected. The difference between the price of Grade A and Grade B and C eggs runs as high as 40 per cent per dozen according to the gsade. Recently there was a glut on the market of lower grade eggs, wiih an increase in the premium for Grade A. More aystematic feeding of laying stock at this time of the year will return more mosey to the producer. The axiom that a product properly produced i* already more than half marketed is particularly applicable in this case.

Itís the Catís Whiskers
That Let It Judge Space
There is an old belief that a cat uses its whiskers to determine whether it can squeeze through a small hole or opening. According to this notion, the whiskers are exactly the same width as the animalís body, and if they touch the sides of the hole the cat will not attempt to enter, writes a corre s pondent to the Indianapolis News
Although not strictly -true, there is a grain of truth in the belief The large facial hairs, known scientifically as ìvibrissae," serve as feelers or organs of touch and contribute materially to the catís ability to move about in the dark. These hairs themselves, of course, are not sensitive nerve endings. Facial hairs of this type are particularly well developed both in number and size, in those predatory species which hunt chiefly in jungles and other thick undergrowth.
There may be a relationship between the catís whiskers and its sense of sight. A naturalist found that cats with their whiskers cut short were unable to judge distances accurately. In experiments, cats without whiskers would repeatedly miss their prey when springing for it. The investigator concluded that the facial hairs aid the animal to fix its eyes on its prey and that it is undoubtedly injurious to remove the whiskers from a cat which must hunt for a living.
Big Lead Deposit On Calumet IslandiHIHiHil
Upwards of 1,000,000 tons of lead and zinc deposits have been indicated by diamond on the property of the Calumet Mines, on Calumet Island, according to reports made to the Department of Mines and Resources.
In addition, Government engineers are conducting experiments upon a little known mineral, bruche, which has been discovered at Bryson and Farm Point, Que., and fintherglen, near Mattawa, Out.
The brucite discovery, made by M. F. Goude, Ottawa mining engineer, has been found to have definite commercial value. Canadian Refractories, Limited, of Montreal. have taken up options on the mineral and plan to develop and market it. It is not a common mineral, and has been found in Nevada, where the deposits differ slightly from those in the Ottawa Valley.
Brucite is a magnesium mineral occurring in crystaline limestone. The Ottawa Valley findings have been found to be pure magnesuim hydroxide. The mineral is described as refactory material and is used all over the world as relining for metallurgical fnrnxnces and other purposes.

ìNow you see it and now you might well be said of Ireland's strange Lake of the Eye which has a way of vanishing over night. Although it covers about 40 acres, it completely vanished in IB33, as it also did once in the early 1800s. It is situated in Greevagh County Sligo, and according to local legend, is under a curse. The curse causes it to vanish from the earth 1 once in every 100 years.
