As he approached the bend. Mr. Tarantino’s rendition of il Tro-va-tore" was just ending. Hut he was artist enough to know that a good singer always gives a song the full works on the final notes. Wherefore Mr. Tarantino threw back his head, opened his mouth terrifyingly and gave “11 Trovatore" all he had. His truck careened around the curve almost in the middle of the road.
Joe Sandham perceived this Juggernaut roaring down upon him a fraction of a second before Mr. Tarantino became aware of the danger. He swerved the Ford sharply to the right. A split instant later Antonio Giuseppe Tarantino got wise to himself died unfinished on his lips. A short babbled prayer to his gods replaced it. With a quick heave he swung his wheel, also to the right.

BEAUTY FOR THE BRIDE!
Every bride naturally desires to surpass herself on her wedding day, so follow out this programme, to give you:self a new radiance on your Happy Day.
Get your “permanent" three wcvk> beforehand. Your hair should lose its “newness” and become soft i.nd natural-looking for the bridal day. If, unfortunately, your hair turns to crisp or fuzzy, you've time to give it frequent mulsified cocoanut oil shampoo treatments, to restore its softness.
Every day for two weeks before the ceremony, devote ten minutes to this facial treatments: (1) at night, before retiring, wash your face with warm water and gentle pal moli vc soap. Rinse with cold water, then pat in tissue cream; (2) using a nourishing tissue cream, spend five minutes daily in kneading, stroking and patting your face; (3) twice each week apply a good face mask.
One week before; set to work on your hands, vsing protective, handsoftening Italian balm generously and often.
Two days before: shampoo your hair, to leave it shining. Manicure your nails. Avoid extreme; shape your nails in conservative rounded tips and tint them with a subdued natural or fragile rose shade.
One day before, apply a face mask, afterwards soothing oxer with a rich cream; and on your Wedding Day, because you're bound to be “jittery" and excited, don't forget to use odorono deodorant cream to banish the odour of perspiration.

NEW STRAWBERRY FILLING FOR SHORTCAKE
After feeling you have had enough of just the ordinary shortcake try this new filling for a dress up day.
lVt cups crushed strawberries.
A; cup whipping cream \Vs tablespoons fruit sugar.
12 marshmallows.
Cut marshmallows in small pieces, add to crushed strawberries, let stand in cool place for at least an hour. Then add whipped cream and sugar. Place mixture between layers and on top. Garnish with whole berries.
A pint box of berries should make this recipe. This mixture can be used very nicely as a dessert piled in sherbet glasses.


No Pay—No Move
At this point a Rhode Island Red rooster, becoming bored with the harem that was clucking about him. took off nicely and made a neat three-point landing on the top of the Ford. From this vantage point he flapped his wings, Inhaled deep of the night air and then crewei* ecstatically.
“Shut up. you Weasel sternly.
“That’s telling him." said Kelly. “Guess he won’t do that again.”
Mr. Tarantino perceived that the opposition was arranged solidly against him. He began to plead.
“Geese guy I worka for." he said, “ileesa one tough uiug. He maka me pay for da chicks, so sure like hell. So"—ho indicated Joe—"you pays me. Den everasing fine. We shaka da hand. We go.”

Then, for a second, there were sounds on the Albany Rost Road saxe a frenzied clucking from the rear regions of the chicken truck.

“Nice going.” she said. “It’s a wonder we aren’t all dead ”

Antonio had not been in Amer-for very many years. But he had resided long enough to know that the best way to comport one's self after an automobile crash is to howl at the other fellow first. He climbed down out of his truck with the intention of howling in a big way.
He had thought to howl all by himself, as howls the lone wolf in the tall timber. But Fate had seen tit to provide him with assistance. As he began picking his way across the road, a strong consignment of clucking chickens followed, doubtless perceiving in him a possible of food. Antonio Giuseppe

HATCHET CEREMONY: The Royal Visit has accomplished something concrete In Canadian politics, If we are to Judge by the evidence of a thousand eye# at Woodbine Park, the day that the King and<Queen were In Toronto
light of the royal smiles, two lesser hearts were seen to warm to
each other kensle King and Premier Mitchell Hepburn, celebrated Liberals, celebrated enemies, In full view of the public burled their political hatchet, so It teamed. Beaming, each endeavored to outdo the other In polltnese, deference. They almost stole the show.
Remembering all the nasty words so recently said about the Federal Liberal leader by our provincial legislative head, we marvel. Are the two really getting together once more In the normal way? Or was the display of affection a one-day vender? We'll have to watch the papers to find out.

CRISIS IN AUGUST: G.

Prophesies Mr. Price: -I see no wsr In Europe this summer .. over Danxlg at any time for another crisis about the first of August. At that time 1 expect the axis powers to make threatening demands against Hungary and Rumania.'*
Personally, we think Mr. Price Is correct. Hitler will either take Danilg unopposed, within the next couple of weeks «before France, England and Russia have signed their trl-poweY pact), or he'll have to shelve his ambitions in that direction, till the harvest Is In the barns, at any rate.

MILKING THE FARMER
Writing an essay on “Cows”, a student rises to the heights of wit when he says: “The most important part of a cow is the receptacle In which the milk is stored. This in called the udder. By a clever arrangement it is divided into four compartments each with a separate tap. By this means the milk is divided at the source so that one part goes to the landlord, one to the mortgage company, one to the government, and one to the farmer man.

A combination of any of the above grains on the basis of their comparative value and of availability and cost should form the basis for a satisfactory ration. During the last two weeks of fattening, five per cent of melted mutton or beef fat should be added to the mixture. This Is accomplished by melting the fat and mixing quickly with the mash while hot so as to avoid large lumps.

FOR MEN OF GOOD WILL
We do not pretend to be an economist, but we have a foolish idea that no one country can solve the woes of today. It is a world condition. Until the world settles down to peace, cuts down the mad armament race, and nations trade again with one another and forget ultra-nationalism, there cannot be a solution of all our difficulties. This does not mean that we should not try to place our own house in order as far as possible. We should. But we should at the same time be prepared to co-operate to the uttermost with other democratic nations in restoring world sanity.—London Free Press.

This dazing navigator won the proud title of “Discoverer of Canada." In 1534 he made his first voyage and landed at Gaspe where he planted a 30 foot cross and claimed this new land for François I of France. The following year he sailed up the river to Stadacona-^now Quebec—where he spent the winter of 1535-6, sailing home in the Spring, carrying glowing tales of this new land of great promise.

Q.—Could you give me any information in regard to sowing salt land. I am dealing in salt this spring and quite a few farmers bought salt to put on land. Others are inquiring about it. 1 have had no experience with it whatever. If you can tell me how to sow and what it is supposed to do,
1 would have something to show. —A.B.. Oxford County.
A.—In answer to yours of the 19th, I would say that we do not advise the use of Salt+ as an application to the soil. Salt does not supply any plant food whatsoever All it does is to liberate a certain amount of Potash, hence the continuous use of Salt simply means the impoverishment of soil. Some farmers have used it on mangels with some results, but there is no logical ren&dn for its use, and we do not advise it.

HALTS NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS
It has been discovered that myopia, or progressive near-sightedness, which has inflicted blindness or thick-Ienscd glasses on thousands, may be checked by the use of adrenalin.
The treatment is simple. It involves only the use of adrenalin eye drops over a period of months, and it may be done at home.
INSANITY NOT INHERITED
New proof that insanity is not inheritable was announced last week before the American Psychiatric Association.
An intensive study of 330 Inmates of state asylums and of their parents, brothers and sisters, and other relatives has failed completely to show that the diseases followed any pattern of inheritance such as the patterns which hold true for physical characteristics.

Naturally we could make suggestions more to the point if we had ft sample of your soil, but I presume that you practise a good crop rotation and apparently use considerable manure. I would suggest that you try 200 lbs. per acre of 0-16-6. This would cost you approximately $3.00 per acre. Applied at the rate I have mentioned, it should give you an increase of approximately 15 to 20 bgs. per acre of oats or barley; about 6 bus. per acre of wheat.

Started in the days of the reign of Queen Victoria, the traditional bread and cheese ceremony on the Six Nations Reservation was observed May 24.
Seven hundred loaves of bread and 700 lbs. of cheese were purchased for the occasion and the residents of the reservation were served from long tables in the Community Hall of Oheweken. Each received a slice of bread and a liberal helping of cheese.

Not a spare minute Is left for Britain's King and Queen on the detailed program of their visit to the United States.
And the minutes have been so carefully allotted that, to meet their engagements, the King and Queen will have to keep exactly to schedule from the time they cros the border at 10.35 p.m., E D. T. June 7, until they leave Hyde Park, N.Y., at midnight, June 11, to return to Canada.
The King and Queen arrive In Washington at noon Thursday, June 8 and into a stay of two days and one night there will compress:
Sojourn In Washington The greeting at Union Station by President and Mrs. Rooaevelt and an official reception committee; a luucheou at the White House; sightseeing in Washington; a garden party at the British Embassy ; a state dinner at the White House, followed by a reception and musicale; a reception at the British Embassy for members of the British colony; a visit to the Capitol; a visit to the Washington Navy Yard; a trip to Mt.

If the Crown were to leave Great Britain this year it would be for the first time in history. But the Great Seal must stay behind, as without it the machinery of government would, at least theoretically, be unable to function.
In the days when kings couldn’t read or write it was indeed indispensable. But gradually, as the keepers of the Great Seal became too powerful, and the experiment» of the Privy Seal and the Sign Manual also put too much power into the hands of a single servant of the Crown, the office became split up so that now there are several Secretaries of State.

it would bf ÿf advantage, While grain Joes not lodge badly, 1 think a small amount of fertiliser of the nature to stiffen straw would impfove sample and perhaps the yield. I recognize the fact that 125 lbs. per acre of the usual fertilizer would stiffen the straw as desired but would not increase yield sufficiently to offset the cost.

In the meantime, her late husband’s will disclosed the fact that she had been treated rather badly. She immediately hurried to the mason and told him to omit the words “Rest In Peace.”
“I’m sorry,” he replied, “but they have already been carved.”
“Very well,” rejoined the old lady. “Just add, 'Until we meet again’.”

RHUBARB
No fruit or vegetable garden le complete without from six to 18 roote, according te the size and needs of the family, of either Ruby or Macdonald rhubarb. Rhubarb thrives best on a comparatively rich, deep, well drained soil The soil selected should be prefr-ably prepared by spading in deeply and thoroughly a good application of stable manure. Where space will permit It may be plowed under. Early the following Spring the soil should be well worked up and a commercial fertilizer, preferably 6-10-5 applied at the rate of five pounds per square rod and well mixed with the soil prior te planting.

THE LESSON IN ITS SETTING
Time.—The First Epistle to the Thessalonians was the first letter by the apostle Paul of which we have any record, and was written about A D. 64. The Epistle to the Galatians was written before the Epistle to the Romans, probably in A.D. 64, while the First Epistle to the Corinthians was written about one year later.
Place.—The city of Corinth and the city of Theaealonica were both in Greece, the former in the southern part, and the latter in the northern; Galatia was located in the northern part of the great peninsula of Asia, known to us to-day as Asia Minor.
St Paul left Corinth in consequence of a determination he had formed to spend the approaching feast at Jerusalem. In consequence of the earnest entreaty of the Ephesians that he would give them the benefit of his presence he spent three years among them on his return from Jérusalem. But the latter part of his eta y was disquieted by reports of disorders at Corinth. Paul could could not leave Ephesus at present, for a “great door and effectual" had been opened to him there. But the occasion was urgent, and could not wait for his personal presence.
1. Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, 2. unto the church of God which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus in every place, their Lord and ours: 8. Grace to you and peace from God our Father ^ and the Lord Jesus Christ. These three verses take us at once into the heart of Christianity.

Select Single Crown*
When resetting crowns., taken from old dng-up clumps, single crowns should be selected, removing all old roots. These are set three feet apart in rows five feet apart Plant the crown so that He growing tip is just below the surface of the soil and tramp the soil firmly. Hoe, dig or cultivate at intervals to loosen the soli and control weeds. After the .Autumn frosts kill the leaves, mulch with straw or strawy manure for the Winter. Remove this in Spring and continue to dig and cultivate. Strong rapid growth of the leaves is the objective. The leaves manufacture the nutrients that develop the roots, in which are stored the reserves of food that make for the rapid growth of the stalks that we use as food in the early Spring. Remove no stalks the first year, but few the second, and after that never more than half the stalks that develop. The result will th be large, long, tender stalks for the table. It takes three or four years to develop a really productive crown.
Every farmer or gardener who baa a good house cellar should grow his own Winter rhubarb. Four to six crowns should be

Division in the Church
10. Now 1 beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 11. For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them that are of the household of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
These divisions,in the Corinthian chunk were fundamentally not caused by disagreement in the matter of doctrine. They divided rather over their respective allegiances to some of the great men in the church of the apostolic age. Some would eay thuy followed Paul in his teaching; others would say they preferred the teaching of A polios; while others claimed to be adherents of the apostle Peter; and then some, probably the most boastful, claimed to be followers of Christ’s teaching. Now, the apostle says that they ought not to be followers of any name, except the name of Jesus Christ, and that all the apostles, himself,
A polios, Peter, and the rest, were saved only by Christ’s death, and recognized only Christ as Lord and Savior.
4:14. I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 15. For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.
16. I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me cause have I sent unto you Timo thy, who is my beloved and faith ful child in the Lord, who shall | put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as l teach everywhere In every church. 18.

The C. G. I.T. .held a mother and daughter banquet on Friday evening June Bill, in Sunday School room of the V ni ted Church. It-«val very well attended and a pleasure to note that almost every girl had her own mother.
The tables and room were beautifully decorated with streamers of
blue and white, the C G 1 T colours. Vases of flowers and the daintily made favours added great |y to the aitistic appearance of
t lie room.	7 ¦¦¦jUggl
Much work was during the year by the different groups, which consisted of a beautiful quilt and many kinds of handicraft. These were on ills-play around the room. In recognition of the quality of work done in 193S-39 a certificate of merit for each group was presented by the National Girls1 Work Hoard of the Religious Education Council of Canada. These framed certificates were also on display.	-
Due to the growth of the C G .I.T under the leadership of Mrs Draper, to the number ot fifty-seven, the gills were divided into three groups, viz — Pioneer, Jolly Gem and Torch Hearers.
The banquet commenced shortly after six u cluck. After the courses the toastmaster, Miss Margaret Dagg, spoke a few words of welcome to all and announced a sing ng which was led by Hev. A. F. Pukes, with Miss Victoria Swartz
assisting at the piano.
Miss Cheslyn Horner pioposed a toast to the King which was responded to by the National Anthem. Miss Jessie Armstrong proposed a tott-t to the Church, which whs leplied to by Rev. A. F. Pokes, w ho spoke feelingly of the gieat work done in this organization, under the leadership of Mrs. Diaper, width is only a part of the C G. 1 T. world wide organization. Then all joined in singing the first verse of “The Chinch is One Foundation. ’
Miss Nancy Poole next proposed a toast to the mothers, expressing how faithful and devoted they to their children, and that it was a duty of every child to return this love. Mrs C H. MacLean replied to the toast on behalf of mothers and spoke of how fortunate the girls were to have this youthful training that was unavailable during their girlhood, and 'how proud these mothers would be to be mothers of young women with such high ideals.
Mrs Alex Horner proposed a very appropriate toast to the C.G.I.T. and emphasized the pur pose and high ideals of their work Miss Orma Smiley replied to this by having the girls rei>eat their pledge and sing their C.G IT
