1920, and subsequent amendments Tlilê Clause had been a part of the Custome Regulations for 20 years. Canadian Packers had had no part in having the 'equivalent’ principle established. It applies not only in res-pect of Meat exporte, but of ail Canadian manufactured products. Under this ‘Equivalent’ Clause, Canadian Packers were clearly entitled to a Drawback of the Duty paid: — American Bacon was Imported, — equivalent Canadian Bacon exported. "
However,, a complication arose in respect of non-exporting Canadian Packers. Inasmuch as they did not export Canadian Bacon, they were not entitled to a Drawback of the Duty paid American Bacon. Non-exporting Packer^ protested, and be-___ of this the Drawback privilege was cancelled. Cancellation was made retroactive. The retroactive feature was clearly unfair, as the Customs Department had ruled that the Drawback applied, and most of the product had already been sold upon that understanding, in other respects exporting Packers agreed with the ruling.
(7) Much of the discussion on the subject of American imports overlooked the fact that the Canadian-Amcrican Trade Agreement was involved in the issue. This Agreement is of high value to Canadian Farmers, inasmuch as it provides the only outlet for Canada’s surplus Cattle.
Moreover, the discussion lost sight of the fact that, even In respect of Pork Products, the movement is frequently in the other direction, that is from Canada to United States. It Is indeed quite possible that within the next few months United States may be a very welcome outlet for some o-f Canada’s surplus Hog product. It lias been eo^tnany times In the past.
CANADA PACKERS LIMITED
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
ricultural production is much above that of the other Dominions, and her geographical position adds greatly to her importance in this respect. The three essential foods which, by natural endowment, Canada is best fitted to produce are Wheat, Bacon and Cheese. And the Agricultural economy of Canada is geared specially to makt her the source of these three products.
FOREWORD
In the following Report, constant references are made to the war. They have to do solely with its effect upon the Canadian Live Stock Industry, and the operations of this Company.
In the war, issues are at Stake greater than any which mankind has heretofore been called upon to solve. But, for a discussion of them, a commercial report is not the appropriate place.
The Directors who write this Report, and the Shareholders to whom it is addressed, are keenly aware that in relation to those issues, the fortunes of a single Industry,—still more of a single business,—are a matter of small moment.
Nevertheless, the war adds to, rather than detracts from, the importance of every unit engaged ih essential industry. By the utmost efficiency of operation, an Industry best serves the Nation, as well as its Shareholders. The necessity, therefore, to attain such efficiency never was so great as now.
on
cause
With the experience of the last war in mind, there was little thought that too much of any of these could be produced.
And yet at this moment there seems a possibility of an embarrassing surplus of both Wheat and Bacon.
From Ahe point of view of Great Britain, this may seem an advantage, —inasmuch as a nearby reserve exists which can be called upon at any timek But from the point of view of Canada, the prospect has some anxieties. For Agriculture is still Canada’s basic industry, and Canadian economic welfare hinges on the purchasing power of the Farmer more than upon any other factor. -
A Farmer cannot purchase other goods with Wheat or with Hogs which he is unable to sell.
The Wheat situation does not come within the scope of this Report,

For this surplus Great Britain Is the logical buyer, and it is earnestly hoped the British Ministry of Food will lay Its plans to take all of it.
This, it is believed, the Ministry can easily do. For, with shipments from Canada of 75,000 cwts. weekly, total supplies will be barely more than one-half normal consumption, and will not exceed the total involved in the ration — 4 ounces per person per week *
Since this Report was set up In type, experts of Bacon have' been stepped up for a period. It Is hoped this step-up may be the 9 of an Increased scale of shipments.

not mean that the war has failed to help the Canadian Pig industry. Very much the opposite is the case. Had it not been for the war, Hog prices in Canada would have been much lower.)
But although there was no general advance in price levels, certain products, of which this Company held substantial quantities, did advance rapidly because of the war. Chief amongst these were the following:—
Hides and Skins—of which there are always on hand the equivalent of
about two months’ take-off.
tocks of which were heavy, because, for several months preceding the war, it had been very difficult to sell Wool in Canada.
Butter and Cheese—At the outbreak of war storage stoc'is of these were
at their maximum.
—of which, because of their distant sources, it is necessary always to have on hand several months’ supply.
An immediate increase occurred in the inventory values of the above products of approximately $579,000.
This advance at some time wilt have its counterpart in a corresponding decline. Therefore, instead of being taken up as Profit, the sum of $579,000 has been set up as a “Wartime Inventory Reserve.”

Let’s Be Patriotic : Use More Apples
Someone wrote me a short time ago, that food columnists had been neglecting the subject of “Dried Apples." In the past we have said a good deal about apples and have given you two or three recipes using the evaporated apple.
If you have not before made the resolution to use more apples and help the apple growers (and incidentally our country’s revenue) make that resolution to-

What a joy to live in this age, when almost everything we buy is graded. Always enquire about the grade when you buy and if one pays a trifle more it is money well spent for guaranteed goodi mean economy.
Some tell me they have been disappointed ak first in Apple juice. Try chilling it. It is then a most refreshing and delicious drink. Have you tried the apple juice when baking your ham? It also makes a splendid liquid for jellies and this jelly to serve with cold meat is incomparable.
One of the fond recollections of my childhood is helping my grandmother dry apples. She used to string them in long strings and it was such fun; then later to he.p devour them was more enjoyable. Children like them to eat raw and they are very healthful. Apples contain just about ns many vitamins as the orange, as also does the tomato,—so let us help the Canadian farmer!
There are several methods for drying apples. You can do it by evaporation or dehydration but for the simple everyday method, the sunshine is very reliable. The yellow transparents are an ideal apple for this purpose but any firm juicy apple will be a success. Peel apples, core and cut in thin slices; place on wire screens or racks (they must have a good ventilation to be a success). Place where they will have bright outdoor sunshine. Take them in at night. If the sunshine is continuous, two days will be long enough, but if not a steady heat leave them an extra day. Of course they should soak in water before using; then cook as any dried fruit. Try % cup of these in a fruit cake sometime and you will be surprised at the moistness it gives. Besides you need less of the more expensive fruits.

Repair all tap leaks promptly, if you would maintain a stainless finish on bathtubs and sinks. Even such an impermeable substance as porcelain enamel (fused directly on steel) is not immune to the defacing yellow stain caused by dripping water which contains a mineral deposit. If soap and water do not remove a stain already made, make a paste of powdered chalk and water, and apply generously.
RUBBER MAT HANDY To keep your porcelain enamel sink immaculately clean and free at scratches, use a rubber mat on the bottom of your sink when you use it for washing dishes scratches may be caused by heavy iron frying-pans, but more frequently they come from the "feet” of chinaware itself. The ingredients of china are similar to those of porcelain enamel, and just as diamond cuts diamond, so china may scratch enamel. It is easy to avoid these scratches.
If you would keep the oven door of your range as clean and sparkling as the day you bought it, never use a damp cloth on it while it is hot. Wipe off all stains and food droppings with soap and water after the range cools.

The Agneses of this world have been leading figures in many real dramas. A very sterling Agnes was "the Roman virgin and martyr, who at 12 or 13 years of age was beheaded during the reign of Diocletian
January 21 by the Greek, Romau and Anglican churches.
St. Agnes Eve, immortalized by Keats, celebrated on January 20, was considered especially a holiday for women, when a girl by divination was supposed to see the form of her future husband.
The vindictive Agnes was Agnes of Austria, wife of Andrew III at Hungary, who devoted herself to avenging the murder of her father, Albert I of Germany. Agnes of Poi-tu, second consort of the Emperor Henry III, led a life of hectic political intrigue in her struggles with the nobility, who, after her husband’s death, succeeded in depriving lier of the guardianship of her son, Henry IV.

LESSON X

INVITING OTHERS TO WORSHIP GOD
By William Ferguson
This Curious World

Psalms 67, 96, 98 Printed Text, Psalm 96 Golden Text: “O magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together." Ps. 34:3.
THE LESSON IN ITS SETTING Tim© — It is generally considered that all of these psalms are later than the time of David, but for determining exactly when they were written we simply do not have sufficient data.
; Place
psalms were for the most part used In the choral singing of the temple, they may be said to relate to the service of worship as carried on in Jerusalem, though geographical details are missing.
In this lesson we find some of the most beautiful expressions relating to the soul's experience in the worship of God that are to be found in the world’s finest religious .literature, be it Hebrew or Christian. Let us saturate ourselves In these worship-less days with just such psalms as these, that our souls may have the most beautiful and heavenly language available for much a sacred act as approaching God in praise and adoration. Old as these psalms are, we supremely need them In this particular age of ours.
This little psalm, like Psalm 66, eeee in abundant harvests a type and witness of God's kindness. And Psalm 67 is evidently much later than the age of David, though It might have been composed even In the time of Hezekiah, when the great hope began to be entertained of God's blessing towards the nation. The psalm is a fervent expression of a well-grounded hope, not a prophecy; it Is the joyful outpouring of a heart which longs to see the God and King of Israel being acknowledged and worshipped as God and King of the world.
SING UNTO THE LORD Psalm 96 le a call for all the earth to sing praises unto the Lord.
1. Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. This ie taken from Isa. 42: 10. Fresh mercies demand fresh expressions of thanksgiving, and the deliverance of Israel from Babylon Inaugurates a new stage in the nation’s history. 2. Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; show forth his sal- ; vation from day to day. 3. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvellous works among all the peoples. Only those can declare the glory of God and his wonders who know God.
WORTHY OF ADORATION 4. For great ie Jehovah, and ho Is greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods. 5. For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but Jehovah made the heavens. 6. Honor and majesty are before him: I Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Sufficient strength is the constant imipartation of God’s own nature to those who constantly abide within the sanctuary.
7.	Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples,
Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
8.	Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory . due unto his name:
Bring an offering, and come i Into his courts.	I
9.	Oh worship Jehovah in holy array:
Tremble before him, all the eaajfch.
Here is a glorious appeal to the nations to acknowledge Jehovah. Men give unto the Lord glory when they acknowledge that God Is himself supremely glorious, and when they desire that all which they do in their own lives may be according that glory, may be a reflection of God’s glory; they are ascribing strength unto Jehovah when they acknowledge that God on the one hand Is alone omnipotent, and, on the other hand, is alone worthy of receiving the offering of the strength of men. Men ought to live in sudh a way that their lives are a constant acknowledgement of and a reflection of the holy character of God himself.
GOD RULES THE UNIVERSE
10.	Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth:
The world also is established that it cannot be moved:
He will judge the peoples
with equity.
11.	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
12.	Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy
18 Before Jehovah; for he c

The rate at which fertilizer is applied to the acre for Wheat has a very important bearing on results obtained, writes Prof. Henry G. Bell of the Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph. Wheat removes a moderate amount of plantfood from the soil. A 30 bus. crop removes 60 lbs. nitrogen, 20 of phosphoric acid and 30 of potash.
If the Wheat soil does not contain at least this amount of available plantfood during the growling period of tne crop, normal yields will not be obtained.
Amount And Balance In the addition of fertilizers It is not the intention of the grower to add to the soil all of the plant-food that a normal crop would remove. However, experiment and experience confirm and establish the fact that if no other factor such as shortage of moisture, poor seed or the like limit the growth of Wheat, the yield is directly influenced by the amount and balance of plantfood added.
Eight tests as to the effect of rates of fertilizers were conducted in representative Wheat growing sections of the province. The following standard fertilizers were use d:—0-12-10,	0-12-6,
0-16-6, 2-12-6, 2-12-10, 2-16-6. These were applied on Yi acre plots at 250 and 125 lbs. per acre, and an equal area without fertilizer was grown as check.
Results are as follows:—
Rate Av. Yield Per Ac. Gain
22.5
29.2	6.7 bus.
35.1	12.6 bus.
The difference in cost ranges from approximately $1.56 and $2.00 for 125 lbs. per acre of fertilizers used on Wheat to double these figures for 250 lbs. per acre.

Evidence that from the Axis point of view the Battle of Britain had entered upon a critical phase was seen last week in the strong and urgent efforts spent by Berlin and Rome In keeping southeastern Europe at peace. So delicate the balance between Germany's (Victory and defeat over England appeared to be, that a conflict arising In the Balkans could upset It . . .
The R.A.F. remained masters of the British sky, and the defences of England held ... It was estimated that one-sixth of the entire German air force was being used in the aerial offensive against the R.A.F. and in the attempt to break the spirit of the British people . . . During the week the German plan of mass bomb i n g attacks seemed to have been abandoned in favor of "nuisance” bombing flights of one or two or three planes; and night after night the sleep of harassed Britons was punctuated by enforced trips to air-raid shelters . . .
"A Nasty Shock”
Hopes of early aid from the United States grew stronger in Britain last week . . . The London Daily Mail said editorially: “The Daily Mail believes we are about to receive further very substantial and valuable material aid from President Roosevelt. It will be a very nasty shock for Hitler when it is officially announced" . .

Harking back to the time of George I (1660-1727), King of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover (Germany), is the birth of Anglo-German royal marital alliances. Later, in 1840, Queen Victoria, descendant of the House of Hanover, married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Wettin became then the regal surname, displacing Hanover.
THOROUGHLY ANGLO-SAXON Then, on July 17, 1917, at the height of anti-Prussian sentiment in the Empire, His Majesty, the I fifth George, acting with the consent of his Privy Council, inform- 1 ed the people that, henceforth the I royal house should be designated I as the House of Windsor. The title cornea from Windsor Town I and Castle, steeped in kingly tradition since the days of Edward I the Confessor More to fill the I Englishman of today with a feeling of complete, historic ownership, no word more thoroughly I Anglo-Saxon probably could have been uncovered.

An Oklahoma City reporter thought a woman newspaper reader was wrong when she complained that "women are losing their common courtesy.”
He held open store doors for 60 women. He turned drinking fountain taps for 20. At store counters he stepped aside 10 times to permit women to be waited upon. Thirty times he permitted women to leave elevators ahead of him. Four times he gave women his seat in street cars. In all, he performed 124 Sir Walter Raleigh gestures.
Two women said "Thank you.” Many gave him that "Don’t flirt with me” haughty eye. He’s convinced.

Cod Liver Oil
Painted A House
Old Binder Has Fine Farm Record
HEALTH
TOPICS
A well-known tobacco farmer living near Brantford recently made the discovery that his entire house had been painted with cod liver oil.
He had ordered the house painted with boiled oil and a can arrived bearing that label. Instead it contained cod liver oil. The painter said he noticed the difference when he did the job, but thought It was some sort of substitute "because of war conditions."
Apparently the whole job will have to be burned off. When the sun shines the oil drips freely from the walls of the house.
A binder, 34 years old, is the possession of Vernon McArthur, well-known Nelson township (Ont.) farmer. The machine has not been idle a single season, and has cut a total of more than 2,000 acres of wheat and grain. Charles Readhead, also of Nelson, made regular use of the binder for 26 years. Following this, the machine was purchased b his son-in-law, Vqrnon McArthur, who has used the binder for the last eight years, and says it is still In good working order.

The young man wrapped his arms round the shapely blonde.
"My darling," he breathed, "you’re all the world to me. I don’t know what I’d do without you. I love—’’
At that moment, the doorbell rang. The blonde jumped up. "It’s my fiance," she gasped. "You must leave at once. Oh, hurry! Please hurry!"
The young man looked round nervously. "But how am I going to leave?" he asked anxiously.
"I can’t go out by the door. Your I | fiance would see me."	1
The blonde thought quickly. "Jump out of the window,” she advised.
The young man turned white.
"But honey," he quavered, "we’re on the thirteenth floor."
The blonde stamped her foot.
"So what?" she rasped. "At this stage of the game, are you going to tell me you’re superstitious?”

DECLINE IN HEALTH FADS
Health-conscious American and they are legion—are about to abandon their "screwy" health fad ideas, says Prof. Arthur H. Steinhaus of George Williams College.
»
Unscientific Beliefs
They are going to drop beliefs that a strong sun tan is good for one, that shrimps and straw, berries should never be taken together, that irregular eating is a common cause of stomach trouble and many others unsupported by ecientific investigation, Prof. Steinhaus asserted in an interview at Chicago last week.
"Screwy" Ideas
"Some other 'screwy* ideas still entertained by. some health enthusiasts arc t lie sc :
"Bow legs result when babies are permitted to walk too early in life, (it's the diet that’s sponsible).
"An outdoor walk is invigorating because there is more oxygen in the open an*.
"The human body renews alF of its parta once every seven years.
“Acid foods never should be taken with milk.
"1 oor posture is one of the causes of tuberculosis.
"Regular physical exercise will increase one’s resistance to most disease germs. (This has been proved false by scientific tests. Healthful living, but not exercise of itself helps resist germs.)
"The chewing of hard foods will strengthen the enamel of the teeth. (It helps the gums, but not the enamel.)
"An athlete should refrain from eating sweets and ice cream while he is in training. (On the contrary sweets form the most rapid source of energy.)"

1. When a husband and wife have invited guests for a motor drive, should the wife sit in front with her husband?
2.. When your hostess places you next to a person at the dinner table, with whom you have rsilently quarreled, is it necessary to talk to this person?
3.	What kind of person would make derogatory remarks about a religion, with which he or she does not agree?
4.	Should a young man, who has had numerous dates with a girl, feci free to enten^cne of her family’s arguments?
5.	Where should the mother of the bride stand at a wedding reception when receiving guests?
6.	Where should the water glass be placed on the tabic?
Answers
1. The wife should ask one of the guests to sit in front, while she sits in the back with the other guest or guests. 2. Yes; it would be rude and unfair to your hostess if you did not. 3. Such a person is very ill-bred, tactless, and rude. 4. Never. If he does, the girl’s father of brother would probably feel justified in giving him a seat on the sidewalk. 5. She usually stands at the door of the room where the bridal party is. 6. At the tip of the knife.

Carelessness and discourtesy . are to blame for nearly all Toronto’s 48 traffic fatalities this year, Acting Inspector Norman Harper of the Toronto City Police Traffic Bureau said last month.
Contrary to general belief, the Acting Inspector said, most traffic accidents happen under relatively good driving conditions, w th cars in good working order and drivers classed as normal.
PEDESTRIANS ALSO TO
BLAME
Firty-one of the fatal accidents have been the result of direct collisions with pedestrians. Although much of the blame lies with the drivers, pedestrians are also to blame. Acting Inspector Harper said, as they often cross streets carelessly and do not always give drivers an opportunity to avoid them.
