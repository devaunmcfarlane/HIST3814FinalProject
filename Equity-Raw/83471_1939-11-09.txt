President Roosevelt Views Gift from King George VI
“Susie, tell pie, why did Uncle Lyman want this room kept so? He must have known that sometime it would be changed."
“He salt! If It was and I disobeyed him, he'd find a way to punish me. Lyman could do all sorts o' queer outlandish things — different things he’d visited when he went travelling That’s why he always left me home.”
"Hut why shouldn’t he leave you home, Susie?" Claire’s grip on the woman’s shoulder tightened.
For a minute Susie did not answer. Then she suddenly broke down. I was his wife —his common law wife, l guess you’d vail it. We — we weren’t never married." She wiped her tears and looked up deft ntly at Claim Uut he recognised me all right. That's why ho left me the money and said Kb and me was to stay here In the house."
Claire had sat down suddenly, as though her knees had gi eu out from under her, while Hannah glared at the moon-faced housekeeper.
Hob Steele’s voice broke the tension. "If 1 were to tell you. Miss Spratt, that 1 think 1 know who It was that tried to bump me off and who came in that window just now what would you say?"

Eggs form a typical food, containing all the elements proportionately for the support of the body. No doubt the price of eggs will rise along with the prices of other foodstuffs due to war conditions and profiteering, but remember one way in xVhich we may do our part in this war is to see that families and ourselves have balanced diets:	These cannot be

Susie glanced at Dan with a new expression in her eyes. Then she said. "I told Eb 1 kept hearing queer things at night but he only laughed at me. Said l had notions.”

SYNOPSIS
CLAIRE FOSDICK sets out to drive to the lonely mountain home left her by her eccentric uncle, LYMAN FOSDICK. Claire is trying to decide whether to marry NICK BAUM, to whom she owes money. She also hopes to find a valuable snd mysterious jewel owned by her uncle and believed to be hidden in the house.
Her car is wrecked by a log ¦cross the road. PAT MAG AN, an sld friend, and BOB STEELE, young engineer, arrive on the scene and take Claire to the mountain house where EB SPRATT and hie •ioter, SUSIE, are the caretakers.
Claire sees a curious arrow carved on the wall of an upstairs bedroom and, lamp in hand, follows the arrow to the cupola. A noiseless bullet shatters the lamp.
Next morning Eb Spratt disappears. Bob Steele sets out for the village and is found seriously injured.
HANNAH. Claire's housekeeper, arrives. Pat, trying to solve some of the mysteries of the place, wanders Into a deserted mine. An unseen opponent attacks him and Pat falls, unconscious.
Claire goes again to investigate the root cellar. She hears a noise, and with a crowbar, digs into the wall. The opening leads to a pas-way in which a man is lying. Suddenly the lamp is shot from her

value to a pound of beef steak. The highly concentrated nutritive value of eggs renders it necessary to use them in combination with other foods rich in starch.
Here are a few general rules about eggs, which are well to remember: Eggs are fresh, if rough and dull In appearance. They should be washed as soon as they are brought in from the store and kept in a cool place. The unbroken yolk of an egg may be kept from hardening by covering it with cold water. If not used in a couple of days, change the water. Keep white of an egg covered in a cool place. For results, never cook eggs at a high temperature, for they will rebel. There is a wide and delightful variety of cooking eggs. Eggs need not al-be boiled or scrambled for

"You sure that's what he said, Susie ?" gritted Dan Dallas. He suddenly rose from his chair and stalked over to her.
"Why Dan—" she began with a coquettish giggle. "Why, Dan how rough you are all of a sudden!"
For answer Dallas stretched out his hand, showing her the official badge he held. "Yes. Susie, maybe I am rough. That's my business. When your brother found that someone had been chipping at the stone foundation of the house — you know you found It when your clothes blew off the line — he got the law to step In. Figured things had got out of his control. Now you’d better come across with all you know, or —"
A blinding flash of lightning crackled through the room, followed almost simultaneously by a deafening crash of thunder. For a moment the old house seemed to rock on Its foundations. Then, from outside, came another terrific, tearing noise. Everyone rushed to the window, just as the great twin-topped pine tree swayed violently once or twice, then toppled to the ground with a roar like a titanic shriek of despair.
For a stunned second no one moved or spoke. Only the pounding of the rain against the window ami the echo of the crash rumbled away into the distance. Then Susie laughed hysterically and the tension was broken. "Why, 1 thought

Each of us has a preference for some particular color, but not all of us know by. A slight knowledge of the - waning of color will help us analyze our likes and dislikes.
It Is wise to consider the characteristic properties of individual colors before we proceed to change the color combinations in our own homes. Red. for Instance, symbolizes vitality, energy, power. It is highly stimulating. Blue signifies tranquility. Psychologically its influence is quieting. Yellow symbolizes light, cheerfulness. Green does soothe, yet exhilarates.

FOR HOUSEHOLD TASKS
Since 1882, thousands of boys of Dr. Barnardo's Homes have left the Motherland for Canada and othei parts of the Empire. These lads, who received their start in life through the homes, have made good in the overseas dominions.
In the dark days of 1914-1918 no less than 6,211 Barnardo boys enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force; 531 of them did not return. "Canada in Flanders" records that one of these Barnardo lads was recommended for the V. C. before he died.

Susie gave one look at the place then collapsed into the nearest chair. "Oh, what would Lyman say If he could see it now!” she sobbed. "His own room that he loved. And I promised always to keep it as it was.”
Dan had succeeded in getting the window closed. Now he and Pat rushed into the hall to search for the intruder. Claire walked on over to Susie and laid a firm hand on her shoulder.
A new search for Amelia Ear-hart is announced by Eric Banner, who left Honolulu last week in the 55-foot schooner Walkyrie.
Manner said he would spend a year in the South Seas searching for Miss Earhart and Edward Noonan, who were lost July 2, 1937, while on a flight around the world. Manner said he was convinced that Miss Earhart still is alive, probably marooned on some island.

became increasingly apparent during t>* course of the week that in the current stage, military conflict wa.i to be vastly inferior in importance to economic conflict. The course of the war could no longer be traced by sticking colored pins on the map.
Chief events centred about the Allied blockade of Germany, and the Reich's efforts to break it. That's what all the sinking of merchant ships, submarines, bombing of naval objectives, on both sides, was about. Great Britain and France, on the offensive here, were hoping that cutting off of all Germajy's trad by sea would result in the collapse of the Hitler regime and the end of the war.

Would Hitler, however, sit down under the blockade and see the war lost before his eyes? Would he content himself with instituting a successful counter-blockade? Would he sell out to Russia more extensively still in order to secure possible further supplies of raw materials? Would the Nazis attempt to break Allied morale, thence the blockade, by perpetrating sudden mass air attacks on densely-populated centres? Would they try “Blitzkreig” on the Western Front, thrusting through Belgium, Holland or Switzerland? The world last week waited tensely for the answers.
What Kind Of Peace?
Foci of interest on the diplomatic front during the same period were the Russo-Finnish conferences from which Russia was expected to emerge as the unchallenged master of the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic; and the An-glo-French-Turkish mutual assistance pacts, n triumph for Allied dpilomacy, by m ans of which Germany, and Italy, too, can be blocked from further expansion in the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. (Worthy of note here is that, contrary to first belief, Germany can still get supplies from Russia via the Black Sea without interference).
An illuminating comment was made last week by Dr. Melchior
Palyi, former economist of the Deutsche Bank of Berlin, speaking in Windsor, Ontario: “The big question mark in Europe is not who will win the war (Germany cannot win) but who will make the peace that follows, and what, specifically will that peace do for the German nation? It must be a just, democratic peace. What the German people are interested in now is what the Allies have to offer them once Hitler is overthrown."
Anybody's Guess
Speculations and prognostications about the future course of the war were rife last week. We give you these for what they are worth: Early renewal of the An-glo-Japaneso Alliance was forecast in Paris by Alain Song, expert on Far East affairs: A real “second world war” is looked for by Roger .W. Babson, noted business * consultant, but when it romes he expects *o see Germany and Japan lined up with England and France, all against Russia ; Alfred Duff Cooper, former First Lord of the British Admiralty, predicted revolution in Germany shortly, followed by the restoration of the monarchy; (ru* r had It that a new moderate German Cabinet is being groomed in London); some observers looked for the war to end by Christmas, or next March at the earliest.

Old man sea himself is no respecter of Dutch neutrality. He frequently violates that neutrality by washing ¦tray mines on Dutch beaches. On such occasions the Dutch coast-guards are faced with the dangerous job of removing the mines and rendering them harmless. Here you see a coast-guard squad hauling a German mine to m safe distance before destroying it bv gunfire Those horns sticking out from the side of the deadly bell arc the contacts. When struck by a ship, or by anyth' ng else, for that matter, these contacts break tubes or chromic acid into a glow cartridge, producing an electric current which seta off a fulminate of mercury detonator that explodes the charge of trogyl with which the

Warm Colors for ~ Rooms On North

A room having a north light or northern exposure receives no direct sunlight and is a shadowed room. The reflected light from its walls will be of a cool quality. Therefore, for painting the walls of this type of room the following warm colors can be used effectively. Yellow, gold, yellow-red or orange, cherry, rose, and, in fact, all the colors that are known aa “warm” colors. The vivid colors are “grayed” slightly to soften theta.

BEAT THIS ONE!
Any person who has fished or hunted to any extent will have a certain experience that he will not relate to friends because of the possibility that ie might be branded a liar. Many strange tales have been whispered over camp fires, but one which came to hand recently a ltd is verified by reliable witnesses stands undaunted as tne fishing tale of all time.
It concerns a young chap, several years ago, having experienced poor luck, and drowsy with the warm August sun, tucked his rod in his row-boat and leaned over the side idly observing his reflection in the still water. Another boy was was dozing in the bow of the boat was aroused by a cry of pain from his companion. He looked up in time to see his friend jump backwards and a five pound trout flop into the boat. The fish had leaped at the boy’s nose and sunk its teeth into the bridge!
The boy’s name is Harry Morse and for many years he was the captain of a boat plying the inland waters of New York State. He carried the scars on his nose al lthrough his life. Edison Schuyler Lott, chairman of the board of the United States Casualty Company, saw young Morse and the fish immediately after the incident and will tell you that the boy’s nose was still bleeding at the time. There may be stranger stories but we haven’t heard them!

Ontario* hunters will be glad to know that automatic shot-guns may carry for any kind of game. This news will be found very welcome in an age when there is so much hysteria and “anti” legislation.

Why We Keep to Right
The automobile driver in the United Slates drives on the right side, rather than on the left as is the. custom abroad, because the American became accustomed to driving his covered wagon on the right. .And the jack he uses in changing tires isn’t so new—similar jacks were used 100 years and more ago by covered-wagon drivers. But the A ican automobile driver owes nothing to the covered wagon when it comes to brakes—the covered-wagon driver had to get out and behind his wagon, setting brakes on the rear wheels from the rear.

Milk Easily Delivered
The milkman at Nome, Alaska, does not worry about spilling his milk. He calls from house to house and delivers a block of frozen reindeer milk or cream equal to a pint or a quart. A white cord frozen into the block of milk serves as a handle to facilitate delivering. The blocks of milk and cream are wrapped in oil paper and look like ice cream. As long as it remains frozen there is no deterioration in the quantity or quality.

Louis Hébert, Canada's first practical farmer, was a member of that lift: a colony at Port Royal (Annapolis Royal) who, in 1605, first attempted to cultivate Canadian soil. Later, in 1616, he settled in Quebec, made a clearing on the'heights of Cape Diamond, cultivated it with his own hands, acquired a fief and became, except for Champlain, the leading citizen of Quebec. Above is depicted a monument to his memory which today stands in the City of Quebec.

K. M. Otis has started his 81st year as superintendent of the Willoughby, Ohio, schools. Unusual in itself Is his lengthy service, but Otis has overcome a physical handicap that threatened the end of his teaching career. Last year Otis had his larynx removed. The operation deprived him of use of his vocal chords and made breathing possible only through a small hole in his throat. Undiscouraged, Otis learned to talk through an accomplishment rare in medical circles.

Q.—How can I tighten the blades of a pair of scissors, which have become loose?
A. Try pressing a hot poker or solder iron on each side of the rivet which holds the blades. The rivet will expand and fit the hole, which tightens the blades.
Q. How can I prepare a good fruit cocktail?
A. Use one cup or orange juice, four tablespoon-* of lemon juice, and three tablespoons of honey-flavoured syrup. Mix these ingredients and serve with ice in cocktail glasses.
Q. How can I prevent moisture from forming on my eyeglasses when going from a cold into a warm atmosphere?
A. Moisten t'..c tips of the fingers and rub them over a cake of soap; then rub them over the lens, and polish as usual.
Q. How can . remove ink stains from white goods?
A. A solution to keep on hand for this purpose is 1 ounce of each of sal ammoniac and salts of tartar. Put into a quart bottle halffull of water and shake well for several minutes. Then fill bottle with water, shake again and cork. Soak the goods in this solution and then wash.
Q. How can l prevent threads in rag rugs from loosening when shaking them?
A. Hold the rugs by the sides instead of the ends when shaking All the pull is on the
when
holding them by the ends and the ru will wear out quickly, as it loosens the threads.

Warning Is being given by the Royal Aut: nobile Club of Canada to all motorists of the dangers that are Inherent In autumn.
Drivers are advised by George A. McXamee, manager of the R. A. C. to take particular care in driving over the highways at this tune because there is nothing. with the exception of wet clay, that is more treacherous than a bed of wet leaves on the smooth surface of the road. With the high-powered cars in vse today the danger of skidding through emergency braking is much Increased as the loose leaves prevent the tires from getting the proper traction.
Rainy Weather Is Bad
Warning is also given that soft shoulders are very dangerous at this time, because of their lack of stability in rainy weather. A fast travelling car getting oft the edge
of the paved surface is almost bound to get out of control in the soft shoulders and land upside down in the ditch.
The club r-lots out that early darkness, slippery pavements, deceptive shadows, rain, mist and possibly early snowballs, all call for extra vigilance in driving, not only to ensure the safety of the passengers, but ilso of pedestri: • ; and particularly children who are using the streets and highways to I go to and from their schools.

320,000 pigs of Victoria, Australia, must slim if they are to be in the export fashion.
A Department of Agriculture bulletin informs growers that the e export trade demands long lean pigs and that they must conform to the "exacting demands of the United Kingdom pork and bacon trade.” With the bulletin goes two pcitures of carcases, one long and lean showing a meaty cut and the other short and excessively fat. The idea is to catch pigs just before that expansive, idyllic period when they develop the middle-aged spread.

A quick hypodermic cure for sprained ankles and knees has been discovered.
Novocaine is injected close to the sprain. It relieves the pain of moving the joint and at the same time helps injured tissues to recover quickly.

Q. 1 have never kept chickens before, and I have a	that
the manure, if kept dry, is a valuable by-product, at least worth giving a little attention to. Am I right? Spenking roughly, after reading your letter I would say chicken manure equalled a 1%-1H fertilizer. If dry, could it be used as a side-dressing on growing crops? What is the value of chicken manure compared to the manure from one horse and one cow, mixed and looked after well? "J.W.P.—Middlesex Co.” ,
A. The analysis of chicken manure would run about l%-3/6 formula. Chicken manure is estimated to have a value of $4.16 per ton while a mixture of horse or dairy cow manure would have « value of $2.28 per ton. From these statements you will see that you are right in assuming that chicken manure is a valuable byproduct. It should be stored so that rain and snow will not wash through it.
A Negro who had been exploring chicken coops heard that the sheriff was after him. Hastily he sought the railway station and asked for a ticket to the end of the line on the fastest train.
"Our fastest train left just ten minutes ago,” he was told.
"Well,” gasped the Negro, "jes give me a ticket an' point out de track!”

Answers
1. No. Wait until the food has been swallowed. Say, "I am sorry,” then answer the question. This is much better •'than saying, "Blub-b-u-rr-gr-um-p-f.” 2. Tell this guest frankly and positively, without displaying anger, that his actions are objectionable. If he persists, speak to your host or hostess. 3. Yes. It is discourteous, rude, and usually ineffective. A well-bred person will always show patience in such instances. 4. Yea. Loquacity is a habit that should strive daily to overcome. Feltham defines it thus: “A talkative fellow may be compared to an unbraced drum, which beats a wise man out of his wits. Loquacity is the fistula of the mind— ever running, sad almost incurable.” 6. The host or hostess I should go first, followed by the guests in the order of seating. This avoids confusion. 6. No; not until leaving the table.

Prof. Drummond of O. A. C. Declares Women Prefer The Comforts of the City
"Easy. Two are on the ta-

It Is far more difficult now for » farmer to get s bride than It Is for a city man, according tq Prof. W. M. Drummond, of the Ontario Agricultural College. Ho gave his own views to the civic farm placement committee In Toronto last week.
Farm Wives Hard to Find He said women preferred the comforts of urban life to the heavy work of a farm wife. There Is not the same attraction about farming for a woman as for a man and the rural marriage problem Is further Intensified because so many young girls leave the farm for city work.
Prof. Drummond estimated three girls left rural homes for ever) farm lad who went to the city.

And lastly, V • Health Department was unanimous that "When is doubt, It throw It out," should be the final rule in regard to all foodstuffs.

If written high school entrance examinations are eliminated by the Ontario Department of Education, forecast by V. K. Greer, of Toronto, chief Inspector of public ..nd separate schools In the province, it will save a considerable amount of worry to pupils in the entrance classes of the public and separate schools of the province.
It will mean also a saving to Collegiate Institute Boards In expenses In connection with the examination of the written papers.
System ef Recommendation The present system of recommending pupils, by the teachers, would be extended somewhat. The recommendations are based on the year's work of the pupils.
Is considered by many educationists to be preferable to a single written test.

Much may be expected of NBC’s "Great Plays" series to Judge by the quality of Sophocles’ "Antigone”, Euripides' "Alcestls” , and the great morality play of the sixteenth century "Everyman” which have been heard for. the last three Sundays over the NBC-Blue network beginning at 2 p.m.
The present series has been prepared with the active co-opëration of the American Library Association and will present four to five representative plays of each century up to the present day. A study manual has been prepared by Blevins Davis, the producer, covering the entire season.

This
In Effect This Year?
The 'system of promotion “by recommendation from grade to grade in the elementary schools has been in vogue for some years. Whether the. eliminations of written entrance examinations will go into effect during the current school year Is not yet known. Chief Inspector Greer intimated it would take place "in the near future."
Lav* Your Entmiee
42. Give to him that askcth thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away. We are to be generous with those who come to as in need, but we ere to exercise discretion and wisdom in these matters. 43. Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. 44. But I say unto you. Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; 45. that ye may be sons* of Father who is in heaven: for he meketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. % Towards your enemy, there must be no flery retaliation, no more chilling toleration, no proud and lofty command.
