•	Using Wget pull all articles from 1939 – 1945
•	Use Regular Expressions in Notepad++ to find text files containing keywords “Germany” and “Nazi”
•	It occurred to me that even between 1939 and 1945 there are still 365 files and searching for keywords Germany and Nazi will likely return an immense amount. Currently considering reducing the sample size to the last article of each month during the span of 1939 – 1945.
•	As suspected, Even with the keyword search Nazi I got 1088 hits in 280 files.
•	After reducing sample size to the last publishing of each month between 1939 – 1945, and running the keyword search again, I now have292 hits in 65 files, a much more manageable number.
•	Initially I wanted to create a map like one that was posted by a previous student researching atomic warfare, but I think with the data-set I have a Timeline might be more appropriate.

•	Office Timeline works…but is not very aesthetically pleasing. Browsing other options.
•	Office Timeline formatting is forcing some of the content off the slide and its being lost (4 Events to be precise
•	It occurred to me at this point that this might be easier in MS Visio
•	I CAN COPY AND PASTE THE TIMELINE INTO VISIO YAY
•	So for some reason I felt I needed to embed the timeline into my browser which was way more complicated than it had to be. I can just export it as an image and upload as media…
•	Well this concludes my Fail Log all that’s left is to put together my paradata essay and submit. It’s been a blast!
